Bloctans: gn
Discord: theotherhades: it would pass on twitter so it should pass on meower
Discord: theotherhades: ok i added PARODY to the nickname you happy @Tnix (NZDT)?
Discord: CST1229: the other tnix
JoshAtticus: (that's what he said)
Discord: theotherhades: wait i have an idea
JoshAtticus: **sad
Discord: theotherhades: at least i still have the pfp and bio
Discord: theotherhades: **** he changed my nickname back
JoshAtticus: appears the same on meower
JoshAtticus: oh lol
Discord: theotherhades: <:Troll:1002690134325604362> <:Troll:1002690134325604362> <:Troll:1002690134325604362>
Discord: theotherhades: i got gifted nitro and i've changed my server profile on the meower discord to be identical to his
JoshAtticus: ?
Discord: theotherhades: @Tnix (NZDT) my transformation is complete <:Troll:1002690134325604362>
JoshAtticus: HD version I guess then
JoshAtticus: 4k video is 3.1GB, I am not uploading that from this laptop
Discord: theotherhades: nah it's alg just kinda funny lol
JoshAtticus: i hope it wasn't like spam
JoshAtticus: lol sorry
Discord: theotherhades: almost the entire page when i clicked on bridge was joshatticus lmao [image.png: https://go.meower.org/cb265012]
JoshAtticus: A11 chip run faster
JoshAtticus: and losing battery very quickly
JoshAtticus: ooooh it's hot
JoshAtticus: how is my iphone losing battery it's plugged in
JoshAtticus: 50%
JoshAtticus: 49%
JoshAtticus: It finished ages ago
JoshAtticus: But 1080p is done
JoshAtticus: All I know is the 4K version is at 39% after 8 minutes
JoshAtticus: And how much my VPN server will like it
JoshAtticus: I wonder how big the 4K version will be
JoshAtticus: 999MB
JoshAtticus: The 1080p version is almost 1GB big
JoshAtticus: Should I upload a 1080p @ 60fps version of my duck compilation to youtube, or a 4K @ 60fps version?
JoshAtticus: When my Apple Watch finally breaks or I get annoyed over no longer getting software updates enough i'll switch
JoshAtticus: I really want to switch to android, but my apple watch and imessage is holding me back
JoshAtticus: Actually idk if it was an A22, i think it might have been an A30
Vetzla: i need one of those velcro gloves so k never drop my phone again
JoshAtticus: My friend used to own one of those, but he dropped it into a lake by accident
Vetzla: samsung a22
Vetzla: its ok, just scratched
JoshAtticus: What phone was it?
JoshAtticus: oof
Vetzla: i dropped my squeaky new phone twice in the same week
JoshAtticus: No
Vetzla: do you have a 72 leaf clover????
JoshAtticus: And she dropped it all the time
JoshAtticus: It looks like it's in really bad condition though because my mum used to own my 6s
JoshAtticus: I have never dropped mine
Vetzla: mine was good for 2 years and onwards came constant dropping and connecticity shattering
JoshAtticus: with optical image stabilisation
Vetzla: you still use iphone?
JoshAtticus: at least it records at 4K 60fps
JoshAtticus: because mine died
JoshAtticus: I'm using my friend's old iPhone
JoshAtticus: Wow iMovie exports are very fast on this iPhone 8 Plus I don't even own
Vetzla: anyway ill research PIL and fix the 2 value array problem
Vetzla: i have in mind taking some stuff from my scratch account and my brain and recreate it in flash
Vetzla: i need shows
Vetzla: oh ok
JoshAtticus: No like for UI and animations
JoshAtticus: **quality
JoshAtticus: hq is high wuality
Vetzla: in scratch?
Vetzla: 60fps hd video?
JoshAtticus: Btw widescreen res is 640 x 360
JoshAtticus: 60 fps looks way nicer
JoshAtticus: Why
Vetzla: i think ill stick with 30 fps
JoshAtticus: Also make sure you turn on hq pen, 60 fps and widescreen in turbowarp
JoshAtticus: Use that logo
Vetzla: cool
JoshAtticus: Yes
Vetzla: @JoshAtticus can i use the whisker M btw
JoshAtticus: **space
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus another reason to keephim ip banned
JoshAtticus: Oh yeah and it has a ****e
Vetzla: @JoshAtticus ill kick him out if he does that again
JoshAtticus: He also made a "beta" which does nothing and stole the Meower logo M
Vetzla: and a lack of PIL knowledge, it spewed out an array of TWO NUMBERS.
JoshAtticus: He thinks he owns the whole thing and that he is the most important person in the project
Vetzla: im using cloudlink
JoshAtticus: Oh ok because that's what roblox said lol
Vetzla: im not usinf vanilma scratch
JoshAtticus: Cloud variables have a max of 5 updates a second
Vetzla: @JoshAtticus yeah but i can breathe, so what
Bloctans: @tnix actually more like:
1 - 10$ = increased limits for month (x by money donated)
10 - 50$ = put on a list of donators
50 - 100$ = increased limits for year + put on a different list of donators
100 - on and on = increased limits for lifetime + put on a different list of donators(meower big fans)
Vetzla: @Bloctans meower orange???? in my meow-this joke failed
JoshAtticus: You can't do a streaming service on scratch
Bloctans: @Vetzla PIL
JoshAtticus: I'm just going to use iMovie because this laptop (school laptop) will take forever to render a 4K video on intergrated graphics
Vetzla: bloctans knowinf you know python, do you know how to convert a video to a bunch of hex values in python?
Bloctans: @tnix what if we had tiers more like:
1 - 10$ = increased limits for month (x by money donated)
10 - 100$ = put on a list of donators
100 - 200$ = increased limits for year + put on a different list of donators
200 - on and on = increased limits for lifetime + put on a different list of donators(meower big fans)
Vetzla: speaking of videos
JoshAtticus: They are all 4K videos
JoshAtticus: btw what's the best way to compile all of these duck photos and videos?
JoshAtticus: No, just to get things like larger file uploads
Discord: tnix: no, it will still be more like donations, you'll pay like $1 minimum and you get increased limits for that month, kind of paid tier but also you pay what you want
Bloctans: because thats the eqivilent of my original option 3
Bloctans: most likely not.
Bloctans: no
JoshAtticus: Will meower eventually have a paid tier like discord?
Discord: tnix: we're probably going to do 2, with increasing limits on features that cost money, such as file uploading or better quality voice/video
Bloctans: @tnix make a poll with:
1. meower merch
2. donations
Bloctans: ok
JoshAtticus: No, remove 3
Bloctans: maybe make a poll:
with:
1. meower merch
2. donations
3. become money hungry
JoshAtticus: But you have to buy minimum 1200
JoshAtticus: I found a platform called squishable.com that makes custom squishmallows
Discord: tnix: we still don't know how we're going to fund servers, because as we add things like file uploading and voice/video calls, it's going to get expensive since we'll have to start paying for cloud servers
Bloctans: well if we want money to support the servers
Bloctans: anyways any plans for meower merch in the future
Discord: tnix: or paypal
Discord: tnix: yeah, he was going to move it to cloudflare, which would require him using his credit/debit card
Bloctans: really?
Discord: tnix: I think he's paying for it with actual money this year
Bloctans: (surious)
Bloctans: so mike can stop mining bitcoin to pay for the meower domain
Bloctans: it would be a great idea for server funds
JoshAtticus: same
Bloctans: like a meowy plush
Bloctans: me too
JoshAtticus: I would buy meower merch if it existed
JoshAtticus: old tos moment
Bloctans: in speaking of meower merch, we should actually do that
JoshAtticus: Because you think you can outsmart the system but you can't
JoshAtticus: Then it costs an extra $15 a minute
Bloctans: what if you live right next to meower media co merch factory tho
JoshAtticus: Which you need a subscription for otherwise it will catch fire during shipping
JoshAtticus: Oh and you need to pay shipping for the physical activation key
JoshAtticus: *per minute
JoshAtticus: and $200 for the ultimate
JoshAtticus: $100 for the standard
JoshAtticus: $15 for the broke people version
JoshAtticus: No, so there's a list of subscriptions and fees

$5 a month for the "free" version
Bloctans: anyways so you have to pay for a subscription that spams emails then you have to play for a subscription to cancel the subscription while it secretly charges your bank account a huge cancelation free
Bloctans: a
Bloctans: coencidince
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus ?
JoshAtticus: Lmao how'd you know what I was talking about
JoshAtticus: I think adding meower orange is a good idea
Bloctans: i saw you guys talkign about meower subscriptions yesterday
Discord: theotherhades: i love typescript
Discord: theotherhades: time to continue learning typescript
JoshAtticus: Imagine having an active social media platform
JoshAtticus: Turns out the IP wasn't on there though
JoshAtticus: I have a list of school-blocked IP addresses
JoshAtticus: I thought the router refreshed to an IP blocked by my school, so I guess my 17 restarts worked
JoshAtticus: Yes! VPN is working today
Bloctans: ye
Vetzla: i show up and its silent but i leave and its a thousand pages of pings
Vetzla: the gocial corner
Vetzla: how bout we call it
Vetzla: yes, brilliant
Bloctans: i wanna just add the ideas it had to sgerb

Vetzla: look i wanna keep the sgerb name, its legendary
Vetzla: what would happen if?
Vetzla: hmmm
Bloctans: uh i wanna merge gocial with sgerb
Bloctans: YAY HES ALIVE
Vetzla: whathappend
Vetzla: i woke up

helloitsme: @Vetzla (ritual to revive vetzla) VETZLAVETZLAVETZLAVETZLA
helloitsme: Gocial+sgerb
helloitsme: If it sees a gocial request it will treat it differently 
helloitsme: @Bloctans ye sure
helloitsme: Of course it needs to be able to handle custom requests that aren’t normal
Bloctans: like a custom gocial mode for the sgerb backend
helloitsme: Maybe sgerb and gocial can share a backend if we do this
helloitsme: @Bloctans ik
Bloctans: (dont merge gh repos tho)
helloitsme: @Bloctans merge. Merge. MERGE
helloitsme: Emojis, sgerb project links, game links, links, gifs, etc
Bloctans: why dont we just merge both
not even make a seperate collab version
just merge both
helloitsme: To be able to handle custom requests 
helloitsme: Nvm. Gocial needs its own backend
helloitsme: @Bloctans sgerb has a backend
Bloctans: ok, but gocial will need its own backend, unless you wanna use the sgerb backend
helloitsme: @helloitsme where you can use sgerb + gocial collab thingy
helloitsme: Maybe on gocial I can add an sgerb tab
Bloctans: oh well time to take over sgerb
Bloctans: i think hes dead
Bloctans: @Vetzla
helloitsme: @Vetzla @Vetzla @Vetzla WAKEUP.
Bloctans: @Vetzla HJhjkdfhkjhd
Bloctans: ok
helloitsme: For some stuff
helloitsme: However… sgerb needs to give credit to gocial. 
helloitsme: C O L L A B T I M E !
Bloctans: @Vetzla
helloitsme: @Vetzla
helloitsme: @Bloctans but I decided to do a full recode cuz my code was bad
Bloctans: @Vetzla
Bloctans: anyways
Bloctans: ok
helloitsme: @Bloctans it used to be onscratch 
Bloctans: also gocial is barely even started
helloitsme: @Bloctans ok
helloitsme: @Bloctans g o c i a l**
Bloctans: we will add the glocial features to sgerb
helloitsme: Maybe we can collaborate 
helloitsme: I don’t want to abandon gocial
helloitsme: @Bloctans wait no 
Bloctans: @Vetzla
helloitsme: @Bloctans gocial* and yes
Bloctans: ?
Bloctans: wanna merge glocial with sgerb? (not like merge repos but abandon current glocial and add the features to sgerb)
@Vetzla is this a good idea
helloitsme: Approved
helloitsme: I like it
helloitsme: @Bloctans seems like a really good idea
helloitsme: @Bloctans ah ok
Bloctans: currently no real frontend, backend for forums are barely finished
helloitsme: @Bloctans wait no, I NEED THIS
helloitsme: @Bloctans I wanna see this
Bloctans: scratch but better
helloitsme: @Bloctans what’s sgerb 
Bloctans: what if we combined sgerb and glocial
Bloctans: WAIT
Bloctans: @helloitsme i also have sgerb to work on
helloitsme: Ok it’s work time
helloitsme: I just noticed he added a repo to the org
helloitsme: What do you think
helloitsme: @Bloctans
helloitsme: I’m trying to make Meower, discord, other social media platforms but fun
helloitsme: And then maybe add more stuff later
helloitsme: Basically discord with steam built In or something idk
helloitsme: I’m thinking 3 games and then let the community suggest games
helloitsme: @Bloctans Ok sure but the game has a level system and other cool things like items. I’m working solo on games page
Bloctans: so like gamejolt
helloitsme: @Bloctans better 
helloitsme: @Bloctans no
helloitsme: @Bloctans discord with games built in basically 
Bloctans: so facebook
helloitsme: @Bloctans social games and chats
Bloctans: ok whats the idea for this site
helloitsme: @Bloctans k
Bloctans: for now ill do a basic auth and respond with session token system for it
helloitsme: Sure. The ip system is flawed. (On different ips you need to make a new account) but it works for now!
helloitsme: Passwords aren’t the main focus right now
helloitsme: @Bloctans instead of passwords, we should connect usernames to the ip that created the username (for now).
CodeBot: Prefix: '@CodeBot '
 Bot info: @CodeBot info bot
 For Help do 'help 1'
helloitsme: @Bloctans I have an idea
helloitsme: @Bloctans wdym
Bloctans: should we make a server security challenge?
Bloctans: hm, for auth, any ideas for auth security?
helloitsme: No passwords yet 
helloitsme: @Bloctans messages and usernames
Bloctans: what first for the server
Bloctans: uh so
helloitsme: @Bloctans I’ll tell md
helloitsme: K
Bloctans: ithink i should just rewrite the entire backend in python
helloitsme: Can we make that work
helloitsme: @Bloctans backend is gonna be made up of js and python I guess 
helloitsme: If he can that’s good
helloitsme: @Bloctans I’m going to ask md if he can make the server communicate with python
helloitsme: @Bloctans yes pls 
Bloctans: @helloitsme best i can do for a backend is python
helloitsme: @Bloctans Srry for late reply I’m just setting up the GitHub 
ShowierData9978: on vscode
ShowierData9978: now i can finally install the deno languge server LOL
helloitsme: @Bloctans md is part of gocial

this is the crappy system im using
--snxwleopxrd: hi
Discord: tnix: Also don't do security through obscurity, if some data needs to be hidden use the server and send requests to the server and back
Bloctans: jus a sec
Discord: tnix: What challenge solving system?
Bloctans: IN THE CLIENT SOURCE\
Bloctans: im gonna obfuscate the system for sgerb challenge solving like hell
Discord: tnix: I deleted it
axestudios: Wierd home v2 isn’t in my group chat list
Bloctans: will
def __repr__(self):

return the class as an OBJ?
Bloctans: @Vetzla can you buy a site ( and subdomains) for sgerb?
axestudios: Yet another crisis on meower ☕️
Bloctans: @helloitsme you dont have to set up svelte in a repl, just USE NODE AND NPM

Vetzla: you have to make a virtual environment, then you install modules in it, and now i can finally convert images to arrays
Vetzla: I FIGRED IT OUT
Vetzla: FINALLY
looserty: bruh.
Vetzla: IN A FOLDER
Vetzla: i have to install it
Vetzla: wait i just realized
Vetzla: "no module named PIL" igiveup
axestudios: i decided to create a discord server https://discord.gg/bDrz7h6B
Discord: tnix: Replit has a svelte option
helloitsme: Why repl?: mobile support 
axestudios: oof
helloitsme: @axestudios idk how to set up svelte in a test repl
axestudios: @helloitsme yeah, all tutorials ****, but youll understand it if you keep making small test projects
helloitsme: I don’t want a book. I just want a good tutorial 
helloitsme: So is the svelte official tut
helloitsme: @Bloctans the docs and tutorial videos are bad
helloitsme: I can’t do this
Bloctans: @axestudios A BOOK????
axestudios: Its how i learned C lel
axestudios: My advice is get a book that teaches svelte
helloitsme: I think I can learn svelte.
helloitsme: I only know python (some) lua(main programming language) and html (some)
axestudios: oof it has like 0 bytes left
axestudios: i found an sd card today so now im getting open shop channel for my wii after i homebrewed it
Bloctans: idk
Bloctans: actually PIL
Bloctans: @Vetzla pip install pillow

helloitsme: Meower is gonna have a lot of trees
helloitsme: If Meower servers are going to be called trees then shouldn’t Meower be named forest
helloitsme: Ohno
Vetzla: not even good old stackoverflow can fix it
Vetzla: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'"
Vetzla: i keep getting this god **** eror
helloitsme: Brb
helloitsme: Maybe when I’m more comfortable 
helloitsme: I can’t send stop motion cuz it might have people in the frames
helloitsme: Alright!
Vetzla: i think i can do stop motion too
Vetzla: ok cool
helloitsme: And I can search for animators
helloitsme: I can code pen animations
helloitsme: !!!!!!!!! 
helloitsme: However that includes photos of my house with people in them sometimes 
helloitsme: What I can do is make stop motion things
helloitsme: @Vetzla
helloitsme: If I need to make a whole entire show then I need help
helloitsme: But I can’t do it alone
helloitsme: @Vetzla I animate
Vetzla: we need original content
Vetzla: yeah, thats the problem
helloitsme: And we can add shows
helloitsme: So we need people to make shows and stuff?
helloitsme: Ah ok
Vetzla: nah its just a netflix-like service
helloitsme: @Vetzla Netflix may be harder but they have api documentation I think
Vetzla: probably
helloitsme: @Vetzla it is possible though
Vetzla: oh ok
helloitsme: It didn’t break he just shut servers down
Vetzla: oh
helloitsme: Yt to scratch but it broke
Vetzla: btw mine is more like netflix
Vetzla: whats it called
helloitsme: Someone made a YouTube to scratch thing before
Vetzla: im using thhis website to set up numpy
Vetzla: yeah
helloitsme: @Vetzla are you here
helloitsme: Ok ty
Vetzla: yeah lemme add you
helloitsme: @Vetzla is there a gc or something 
helloitsme: alright
Vetzla: im tryna convert images to arrays using numpy
Vetzla: yeah sure
helloitsme: Can I help you with meowstream
helloitsme: @helloitsme scratch blocks look like legos
helloitsme: No distractions 
helloitsme: They are simple
helloitsme: I kind of like the blocks lol
Vetzla: theyre just, cubes?
Vetzla: uxgly
helloitsme: @Vetzla a
Vetzla: but the blocks are kinda ****
Vetzla: its pretty cool
helloitsme: @Vetzla oh

helloitsme: Nyan cat is a good video lol
Vetzla: i have turbowarp with the extension loaded here
Vetzla: alright so you know how to link the meower test server to cloudlink
helloitsme: Why did auto correct say “my”
helloitsme: Test server provided by meower
Vetzla: ok im installing python, ill boot up visual code and use the script to convert nyan cat to a streamable thing
Vetzla: niice
helloitsme: @Vetzla bingo
helloitsme: wss://cl4-test.meower.org
Vetzla: assume you found it
Vetzla: ok
helloitsme: I know a server brb
Vetzla: maybe i can send the result to a server where cloudlink reads it and streams the video
helloitsme: I know a test server
helloitsme: Hang on brb
helloitsme: Oh
helloitsme: It’s possible-
Vetzla: i dont know anything about python but i think i have a script that converts images to arrays
helloitsme: I read cl docs
helloitsme: Uh… maybe you can use a repl?
Vetzla: sure, im tryna find a server
helloitsme: @Vetzla can I help
Vetzla: ok SO im gonna try to stream video using cloudlik in scratch

Snx: @CST1229 huh, ive never had that happen to me. maybe its been fixed?
Snx: @axestudios invite to the firefox club coming right up

Snx: @CST1229 yeah st literally linked to a zinnea vid on yt in scratch news xD
axestudios: Hi
Discord: CST1229: i don't even get why discuss/youtube exists, the main site doesn't modify youtube links at all (although it also doesn't linkify them)
Snx: also hello axe
Snx: @CST1229 yeah and we're supposed to use the forum youtube links but they linked directly to youtube once
Discord: CST1229: the scratch frontpage semi-directly links to tumblr, through scratch news icons

Discord: CST1229: """technically""", discord should be allowed since it has a professional moderation team (trust & safety)

helloitsme: Oh wait docs
helloitsme: Like coding
helloitsme: Just svelte 
helloitsme: Not Meower svelte
helloitsme: How do I use svelte
helloitsme: I am confuse

helloitsme: :)
helloitsme: I think you guys forgot about this: https://beta.meower.org/
zedthehedgehog: huhuuh
zedthehedgehog: u
zedthehedgehog: hi
looserty: Hey, retaining the update and rewrites of Meower Svelte, I was wondering if I could help with basic functionality, such as modification to the DOM and over minor improvements and updates.
helloitsme: Ok bye I guess
helloitsme: Well not yet
helloitsme: 5 nodes exist
helloitsme: It isn’t very complicated (to me at least)
helloitsme: @Showier @MikeDEV @Semisol is redbase useful?
Snx: @Snx **i will be back
Snx: gtg be back in a little under an hour
helloitsme: @Snx ok
helloitsme: @helloitsme multipurpose cloud computing 
helloitsme: Redbase: a server information retrieval service. And it can be a server
Snx: @Snx **recommend
Snx: @helloitsme well ok i highly reccomend it
helloitsme: @Snx I dont
Snx: (gotta ask this every time i log on xD) ANYONE WHO USES FIREFOX AS THEIR MAIN BROWSER CAN GET IN THE FIREFOX CLUB
helloitsme: @Snx hi
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 k
helloitsme: I didn’t mention the receiving server is the client (not a server) making the receiving server a server is optional and requires that server to trust your redbase
ShowierData9978: I need to go in 4 minutes btw
Snx: im here for like 5 minutes
ShowierData9978: I mean probably 
Snx: hello
helloitsme: I think I can
helloitsme: Could I make this work?
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 ok
helloitsme: The bridges decode the redbase group files and then it rebuilds the file that was sent in the redbase packet
ShowierData9978: If you have a lot of the same data in a row, it compresses that into 1 or 2 bytes
helloitsme: @helloitsme then it becomes a redbase group
helloitsme: Nodes split a redbase packet
helloitsme: Wait I have idea
ShowierData9978: Compression depends on the contents of the file
helloitsme: 10mb max unless compressed 
helloitsme: I guess I will have to lower the file size
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 e
ShowierData9978: That's just fragmentation frames?
helloitsme: It splits into more 1 mb files
helloitsme: Well a redbase packet isn’t just one whole file
Discord: MikeDEV: or just outright network bloat
helloitsme: @MikeDEV hmmmmm
Discord: MikeDEV: @helloitsme On top of that, websocket has a relatively small buffer, you can't send a lot at a time, realistically 1 MB at most per message

anything beyond that, you run into message fragmentation frames
ShowierData9978: TCP is what powers http
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 raspi
ShowierData9978: Where I bought the 4gb ram model 
helloitsme: A
helloitsme: I don’t even know what tcp is
ShowierData9978: Exp on something like a raspi
Discord: MikeDEV: @helloitsme if you don't properly manage your TCP buffer you could easily cause memory issues
helloitsme: @MikeDEV only the server can make these requests 
ShowierData9978: Low level networking proto
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 websocket
Discord: MikeDEV: @hellotisme You do realize that having a 2GB maximum packet size have DDoS ****ential
ShowierData9978: (websockets are an example of that)
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 what is that
ShowierData9978: helloitsme you will probably want to use a TCP driveration then 
helloitsme: Is redbase useful though
helloitsme: @Semisol so you can handle multiple requests at one time
ShowierData9978: Packet**
helloitsme: Do you think this is useful
ShowierData9978: Basically max file size
Discord: Semisol: but why do you need that large files
helloitsme: @Semisol max file size
ShowierData9978: I assumed it's fos
Discord: Semisol: @helloitsme#0000 why do you need 2gb files
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 they forget everything after a packet leaves though
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 I own the nodes lol
ShowierData9978: Probably the node owner too
helloitsme: It will also report the node to the dev (me)
helloitsme: If the packet can’t communicate with the node it’s going to it will find another node and try to use that one
helloitsme: One thing though
helloitsme: Regular packets have to split up
helloitsme: Redbase packets are packets but they can hold more packets and they can hold entire files the maximum file size is 2gb
helloitsme: Redbase packets:
ShowierData9978: I have not been able to find my ID 
helloitsme: I’m gonna continue talking about redbase lol
ShowierData9978: Gotta wait tho
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 ok
ShowierData9978: Im just arriving at my school lol 
helloitsme: And they can become a server
helloitsme: They also work as bridges between servers
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 nah they do more
helloitsme: If they don’t find it within 3 seconds they mark it as lost and move on
ShowierData9978: So, basically cl listeners?
helloitsme: Redbase nodes are simple servers running python code and looking for a very specific  packet they were assigned to
helloitsme: A client isn’t really a server so it communicates with two servers
helloitsme: Server one redbase node and the client
helloitsme: It communicates between three servers
helloitsme: It can also do other stuff 
helloitsme: It’s a server that works with other servers by grabbing and giving information 
helloitsme: I made this thing called redbase
helloitsme: Oh yeah
helloitsme: Uh
Discord: Semisol: idk
helloitsme: @Semisol what do we do though
helloitsme: Ok
Discord: Semisol: idk
helloitsme: @Semisol hello
helloitsme: If you had to choose between discord and Meower what would you use
helloitsme: What do we do
helloitsme: Quack
Discord: Semisol: @helloitsme#0000 quack
helloitsme: @Semisol are you still online
helloitsme: It’s morning- oh diff timezone 
Discord: Semisol: o/
Discord: Semisol: gn
Discord: tnix: Anyway I really need sleep, gn
helloitsme: I saw something about the password thing
helloitsme: I have no idea how backend works
helloitsme: Front end PLEASE
Discord: tnix: Do you want to do frontend or backend?
helloitsme: Sure
Discord: Semisol: svelte client?
helloitsme: @tnix y e s
Discord: tnix: Yeah, sure do you want to help with rewrite?
helloitsme: Can I help work on Meower 
helloitsme: a
Discord: tnix: Yeah, but getting the wrong password and waiting almost 5s to be told that is a little infuriating
helloitsme: Hello?
Discord: Semisol: at most 5s is fine
Discord: Semisol: @tnix the issue is you're not going to log in every 5 minutes
Discord: tnix: Passwords imo should take 1-2 seconds, you are giving up a bit of security for user experience, but bcrypt with a salt gen of 12 is already pretty **** hard to brute force and the tradeoff is worth it imo
helloitsme: Maybe I can do security and client stuff
helloitsme: I kind of want to help do something with meower
Discord: Semisol: because now it's harder to brute force it
Discord: Semisol: @tnix well it also is a plus
Discord: tnix: @Semisol I'm not fully thrilled about that, if you get your password wrong it'll take 5-7 seconds to tell you aaaaa, but ig just use webauthn lol
helloitsme: For gocial 
helloitsme: What should I use: turbowarp or scratch
Discord: Semisol: this will be more secure against data leaks, at the cost of making logins with passwords take 5-7 seconds
helloitsme: Ok
Discord: Semisol: the passwords are already secure enough, but we're going to add a bit more security so that we can run servers on the cloud
helloitsme: But what about data leaks and stuff 
Discord: tnix: But, more code just to keep a dying client alive
Discord: tnix: Our solution to better password security was having an external prompt in html to log the user in
helloitsme: I just remembered I made an encryption thing 
helloitsme: !!!
Discord: Semisol: and we cannot fit trees and a lot more features like better password security without hacking around scratch limitations or moving to svelte
helloitsme: @Semisol ok
helloitsme: Gocial is compatible with cl
Discord: Semisol: we will be moving the scratch client's mod panel which was the only reason it was better to an external site protected by cf access
Discord: tnix: Like a ton
helloitsme: I’m gonna make a bridge of Meower to gocial 
Discord: tnix: The amount of people using the scratch client have dropped as well
Discord: Semisol: compatibility is too much of a burden and it's not worth it for just the scratch client
helloitsme: Ok
Discord: Semisol: we planned that on the 0.7 rewrite but now that we are skipping 0.6 and 0.7 and jumping to 1.0, we have decided to throw it out
helloitsme: Also connected to red base and red base makes it faster
helloitsme: But it’s the users choice if they want to use scratch meower
helloitsme: It will be slow
helloitsme: Soketi to cloudlink bridge
helloitsme: Hehe
Discord: tnix: But we won't provide any official ones, sadly
helloitsme: I just had an idea
helloitsme: …
Discord: tnix: We're not going to block scratch clients, if a soketi extensions is made for scratch, it can continue to live
helloitsme: Oh.
Discord: tnix: Officially, yes, but Mike and maybe some others may continue it
helloitsme: Wait so does this mean Meower scratch client is dead
Discord: tnix: It was the cause for things like the setid vuln, I don't feel bad for it /hj
helloitsme: R.I.P cloudlink. You will be remembered 
helloitsme: @tnix ok
Discord: tnix: It's sad, but will help with scaling and reliability
helloitsme: @tnix woah
Discord: tnix: Cloudlink can only handle a few thousand clients online at once per instance, whereas soketi can handle around 200k online at once per instance
helloitsme: @helloitsme gui preview one
helloitsme: @tnix ik i meant Meower isn’t gonna use it
helloitsme: I can’t believe I’ve been with Meower since the beginning 
Discord: tnix: Cl is not dead, cl in meower is getting replaces with soketi, because it'll help us scale better than cloudlink
helloitsme: Rewrite = cool  cloudlink dead= sad :(
helloitsme: Cloudlink is dead?
helloitsme: Rewrite?
helloitsme: Cloudflare.
helloitsme: I just noticed that even though my website has html code it’s blank
helloitsme: Uh
helloitsme: I CAN STAY LETS GOOOOO (i think?)
helloitsme: I read a new post
Discord: tnix: Yeah, now it's release 1.0 (or just 1.0.0)
Discord: Semisol: beta 6 is no more
Discord: tnix: Meower rewrite, from the ground up, and going to be COPPA compliant
Discord: tnix: Check the forums, I put an update out
helloitsme: @helloitsme probably 
helloitsme: When beta 6 comes out can I come back when I’m older
helloitsme: @tnix ok
Discord: tnix: Kind of
Discord: tnix: I am here
helloitsme: Nobody is online :(
helloitsme: I am convinced that over a few months I forgot how html works
helloitsme: Bugs.
helloitsme: Nvm I’m going to close the issue rn
helloitsme: @helloitsme wait how did it change the name last minute 
helloitsme: Cloudflare in a nutshell 
helloitsme: “This site can’t be reached

JoshAtticus: I still really want to fix bettermeower on mobile, I don't know why it's broken
JoshAtticus: Yay, my mum said I can buy some new domains, so I will get osmanic.com and bettermeower.app for me, and sgerb.com for cat
JoshAtticus: Yeah, obviously
Discord: tnix: but morally, we should protect them from inappropriate things and implement things that allow parents to monitor and mange their kids activity
Discord: tnix: that seems fine, it seems like COPPA is mainly just for protecting kids privacy, not really protecting them from inappropriate things
JoshAtticus: oh no I think tos;dr has infected me with legal nerd virus
JoshAtticus: and or legal guardians
JoshAtticus: COPPA for schools is where a school or educational institute can agree to the privacy policy on behalf of parents
JoshAtticus: is optional
JoshAtticus: Essentially, COPPA must be enforced, parents must read and agree to the privacy policy, usage of third party plugins and services (including cloudflare) must be disclosed in privacy policy, geolocation data may not be collected (excluding ip addresses), parent consent must be verified (such as through a parent email address), and COPPA for schools compliance

Discord: tnix: that's going to be per user themes, but yeah I agree the contrast is too much and it'll be improved to fit in more with the rest of the design
JoshAtticus: That looks really cool! Apart from that blue, the contrast is too much
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 yeah, please find any information you can on COPPA
Discord: tnix: "depth" is this design [image.png: https://go.meower.org/de85fe18]
JoshAtticus: **rewrite
JoshAtticus: Also when you say "depth" design, what do you mean? Is that like my meower website rewite, or zed's
JoshAtticus: Can I help find information on getting COPPA certified
tnix: https://forums.meower.org/t/the-great-meower-rewrite/384
JoshAtticus: oh nice to see you online tnix
Discord: tnix: hi
JoshAtticus: hello again
JoshAtticus: gtg will be back soon
JoshAtticus: I need ideas for new features anyways
JoshAtticus: Although I'm not adding any bettermeower 1.5.0 features until svelte 1.5.0 is no longer a dev preview
JoshAtticus: Well svelte 1.5.0 features can now be used on bettermeower
JoshAtticus: no more double post on https://svelte-1-5-0.bettermeower.pages.dev
JoshAtticus: Oh hey that bug is fixed
JoshAtticus: things that are stressing me out (from worst at the top to least concerning at the bottom)

-cat
-school and grades
-meower talking about age
-losing my best friend
-being bullied at school by attention-seekers
-domain expiring
JoshAtticus: osmanic.co domain just expired and now I need to convince my mum to renew it
JoshAtticus: I really can't handle all this stress
JoshAtticus: :(
Discord: theotherhades: lol yeah get some sleep
Discord: ShowierData9978: its 11pm for me
Discord: ShowierData9978: ig il go to
Discord: theotherhades: enjoy dinner i presume
Discord: theotherhades: bye tnix
Discord: ShowierData9978: k
Discord: tnix: anyway gtg
Discord: theotherhades: as much as i love mdwalters and all the other under 13s i love swearing more
Discord: tnix: it's either get parental verification right now or ban users, I'll do parental verification if people are happy with that
Discord: tnix: we can require parental verification via email for now, would probably take a few hours to implement
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+
Discord: tnix: any idea for what we do right now are welcome
Discord: ShowierData9978: b6 is currently planned out of the window
Discord: tnix: @CST1229 we don't know what we're going to exactly do over the next few months during rewrite, but definitelly going to allow <13 users after rewrite
Discord: ShowierData9978: no, it was planned for b6 but....
Discord: CST1229: until rewrite happens
Discord: CST1229: *oh, so only temporarily banning <13 users basically
Discord: CST1229: @tnix oh, so only temporary basially
Discord: ShowierData9978: started here

Discord: tnix: it's going to take a while and a lot of work, but we can do as much as we can to be COPPA compliant
Discord: tnix: @CST1229 scratch gets away with it by doing the bare minimum (requiring parent emails), and isn't primarily a social media site, but anyway we're doing a full rewrite for Meower over the next few months and are going to be COPPA compliant
Discord: CST1229: i feel like meower is gonna shut down soon
Discord: ShowierData9978: dang this was a fun random joke convo
JoshAtticus: @CST1229 oooooooh
Discord: ShowierData9978: yeah, we are redoing that /srs
Discord: tnix: what if we charge them per minute, and more based on whether they're online at peak hours or not
Discord: theotherhades: the only thing you can get for free is an orange screen with the meower logo in the center and a link to https://store.meower.org where we'll sell everything
Discord: CST1229: re: banning <13 users [image.png: https://go.meower.org/1a1ddc29]
JoshAtticus: dang I gtg
JoshAtticus: Just like fuel prices in Australia
JoshAtticus: But cheaper on Tuesdays
Discord: ShowierData9978: including the char that was just added
JoshAtticus: And it's more expensive on Wednesdays
Discord: ShowierData9978: @tnix times the current len
Discord: tnix: well ofc, that's the normal sub to get access to meower plus the registration fee
JoshAtticus: $95 to be exact
JoshAtticus: And you have to pay to create your account
Discord: tnix: maybe it should be like $20 per character to be hashed, so longer the password the more you have to pay
Discord: theotherhades: they have to pay for the flight
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix we send a meower secret service (MSS) agent to their address to watch over them at their computer
JoshAtticus: But if you don't pay $15 for that tier, then your home address, social security number, phone number email and credit card details are included
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades but then they'll just steal the code from any good password hashing algorithm
JoshAtticus: First tier still costs $25 a month, otherwise your password is included in every post/comment you make
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix add a second tier after plaintext where they have to write their own hashing module, then have a big price jump to the half hashed one
JoshAtticus: tw*tter is a very bad word
JoshAtticus: Oh I am so sorry i accidentally swore
Discord: ShowierData9978: (not like im trying to cover up the fact autocorrect did not save me)
JoshAtticus: ah ok
Discord: ShowierData9978: intentional mispell
JoshAtticus: Intentionally?
Discord: ShowierData9978: @theotherhades ThisPasswordIsIntencanlyWeak
JoshAtticus: @tnix No it needs to be another $100 sub
JoshAtticus: no tnix100
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades make it have tiers, one is plain text (available on API), one is half hashed with SHA256, one is full hash with SHA256, then it's hashed with bcrypt with no salt, then at bcrypt with salt, then another $50 sub to make it private
Discord: theotherhades: who me?
JoshAtticus: Also why does tnix's alt use a bettermeower pfp?
JoshAtticus: Yes that is a great idea
Discord: theotherhades: https://api.meower.org/fetchpassword?user=tnix100
JoshAtticus: Great deal
JoshAtticus: so you can buy 512 for the price of 1024
Discord: tnix: it gets better as you go up[
JoshAtticus: It doubles each time
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix they need a $55.59/month subscription to meower platinum for their password to be hashed and private, otherwise it can be fetched from the api
Discord: tnix: no, 10
JoshAtticus: No eight
Discord: tnix: and four for the price of 10?
JoshAtticus: And two for the price of four!
JoshAtticus: No, buy one for the price of two! It's simple
Discord: ShowierData9978: 8$ for sending a post
Discord: theotherhades: and it's buy one get one half price
JoshAtticus: OMG THAT IS THE BEST IDEA I HAVE EVER HEARD
Discord: theotherhades: simple
Discord: theotherhades: so we just charge a subscription for a pamphlet that tells them what subscriptions are for what product keys and what product keys are for what products
JoshAtticus: yeah, and $20 to reset password
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 nah, $10 for each password attempt, it costs the server time checking their password hash, poor server
JoshAtticus: And $5 for every time they see a post
Discord: theotherhades: people will get tired of remembering all the product key subscriptions right?
Discord: ShowierData9978: (this is great as a joke convo)
JoshAtticus: Or clicks on a button/link
JoshAtticus: Or logs out
JoshAtticus: We need to charge $10 every time someone logs in
Discord: theotherhades: 😲 big brain idea i just had
Discord: ShowierData9978: (lmao)
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix and charge a subscription for a product key as well
JoshAtticus: no put it on that weird headset that kills you
Discord: theotherhades: no that's selling out to zuck
Discord: tnix: make our own VR headset
JoshAtticus: No make meower only available on meta quest pro
Discord: theotherhades: @cat nah 4d is better
Discord: tnix: @cat so the 1st one was already done by the 2nd one, but what does Meower 3D look like
Discord: ShowierData9978: and you need the old sub to cancel the new one
Discord: cat: 1. I call dibs on making the next major decision for Meower
2. Meower is becoming 3D
JoshAtticus: But you need a subscription to get that subscription
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 a subscription cancellation subscription? I like it
JoshAtticus: @tnix No, you need a subscription to cancel the subscription
JoshAtticus: and use a different email address for each email like facebook
Discord: tnix: offer the option to cancel the subscription, but do what adobe does, charge them a massive cancellation fee
JoshAtticus: no unsubscribe button
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades go to the store and buy one, duh
JoshAtticus: with ads to buy the pc and subscription
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades no we spam your email
Discord: ShowierData9978: thats what the product key is
Discord: theotherhades: @joshatticus if it explodes there's no one to buy more subscriptions
Discord: cat: @cat it mine now
JoshAtticus: No you need to add a subscription to own the pc, or it explodes
Discord: theotherhades: also there's meower gold which gives you meower orange perms as well as 1 extra character on the post length limit for every $9.99 you spend per month
Discord: ShowierData9978: and the reader and computer explodes after the product key expires
Discord: cat: I call dibs on meower
Discord: tnix: but also, we need them to pay some validation fees for actually verifying the product key once they enter it into Meower
JoshAtticus: I always used the free version, but it would only update drivers for bluetooth and usb, nothing useful
JoshAtticus: iobit is a scam
Discord: cat: don’t give nvidia ideas
Discord: theotherhades: and the product key expires after a week
JoshAtticus: $9.99 a month for iOBIT driver updater premium
Discord: theotherhades: oh and the meower pc with vhs reader only runs men os which you need to buy a product key for
Discord: cat: @tnix agreed
Discord: tnix: no, drivers should be a subscription
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades And pay $19.99 for the driver disk
Discord: theotherhades: @cat vhs tapes so you have to buy the Meower PC with VHS Reader ® as well
JoshAtticus: I only moved dash to bottom of the screen with unity tweaker
JoshAtticus: No, I haven't messed around in settings
JoshAtticus: Ubuntu Unity 22.10
Discord: tnix: what OS are you on?
JoshAtticus: 









but only right works on linebreaks
JoshAtticus: LEFT SHIFT WORKS FOR SHIFT 
Discord: cat: meower orange is distributed on dvds
Discord: tnix: any if your keyboard works properly
JoshAtticus: no only right shift works
Discord: tnix: any shift is linebreak
Discord: theotherhades: or dog if you're weird like that
JoshAtticus: bruh it stopped working
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix for your cat you know
JoshAtticus: sdfgdfgSFDgdfg
JoshAtticus: ghDFgfdg
Discord: theotherhades: 110%
JoshAtticus: wait what when was right shift linebreak!?!?!??!
Discord: tnix: why would you buy multiple of Meower Orange?
JoshAtticus: No, 99%

Discord: theotherhades: 80% shipping fee
Discord: theotherhades: @JoshAtticus#0000 the shipping fee should be a percentage though so the more the buy the more they pay
JoshAtticus: Because we need to send you a physical activation key letter thing
JoshAtticus: Include the $139 shipping fee
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades ah true, $29.99, with some tax "for payment processing" (but they actually already have to pay for payment processing anyway)
JoshAtticus: **$2900
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades **$290
Discord: theotherhades: *$29.99
Discord: theotherhades: (hint: it actually is)
JoshAtticus: lmao linebreaks just worked
Discord: theotherhades: $29 so we trick people into thinking it isn't actually $30
JoshAtticus: @tnix yes
Discord: tnix: *be smarter
Discord: ShowierData9978: (monthly)
JoshAtticus: >>> babe <<<
Discord: tnix: nah, we better smart than musk, we keep it at the original $20, more profit
