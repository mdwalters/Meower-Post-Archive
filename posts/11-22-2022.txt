axestudios: @JoshAtticus no, no, no, your ask your dad first, then your mom, then your brother /j
Bloctans: i wanna attach my email as my parent email cuz i dont wanna get my parents involved
theotherhades: i don't think your way older cousin counts as your legal guardian but idk
Snx: *my existence exists*
JoshAtticus: no parental controls for me (hopefully)
JoshAtticus: I asked my mum if she would turn on parental controls and she said yes so now I'm gonna ask someone else like my way older cousin
axestudios: @theotherhades lmao true
Snx: @axestudios joe biden /dkm
theotherhades: @axestudios let's be real the under 13s are just gonna put one of their emails for the parent email or just lie about their age

Bloctans: @axestudios what Bot are you tlaking about in "I wonder how parents are gonna feel about meower when they see that bot üò≥"
Snx: @JoshAtticus i am slushed
JoshAtticus: imagine adding that
JoshAtticus: @Snx yeah lol
Snx: @JoshAtticus i saw :slushed: and it made me laugh xD
axestudios: @theotherhades I'm not taking about people like rokcoder, I'm talking about the parents that moderate their children in mower 1.0
Bloctans: @axestudios what bot
Snx: *exists*
JoshAtticus: üò≥
JoshAtticus: the school opened a captive portal popup on my computer saying that they have terminated a connection to *vpn IP here*
theotherhades: tbh i don't think there's anyone on meower above 20 so i doubt there's any parents here
Bloctans: @axestudios what bot
JoshAtticus: lmao
axestudios: @theotherhades I wonder how parents are gonna feel about meower when they see that bot üò≥
Snx: @axestudios nah i just find it funny tbh xD
theotherhades: the sooner we get them hooked the better
theotherhades: i should implement meower streaks into @yourmother
JoshAtticus: gossip gossip gossip

Discord: theotherhades: @snx fuehrer truck <:Troll:1002690134325604362>
Snx: @theotherhades they would rename it to howler (because howler monkeys *laughs in bad joke*)
Discord: theotherhades: the monkeys would prefer to write their own programming language to write meower in
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix too easy for them
Snx: @JoshAtticus uh firetruck starts with fi, not fu
Snx: @axestudios you remember roblox kid going too far last night, right?
JoshAtticus: @tnix word that begins in fu and ends in ck: firetruck
axestudios: @Snx uhh what's going on lol
JoshAtticus: I forgot to press Win+L
JoshAtticus: Oh my friend deleted my Meower account, don't know how or why, he just did
Snx: hello axe who i am not in fact dating (roblox kid goes too far)
Snx: @JoshAtticus what happened?
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus I talked to Mike about it, and he said there are no recent database backups, in CL4 port we'll start taking daily backups to help with this kind of thing in the future
Discord: tnix: his account was deleted by his friend yesterday, he can probably explain it further
Snx: @JoshAtticus btw i re-added you to uwu crew group chat, you got removed for some reason
Discord: tnix: brain(word that starts with fu and ends with ck)
Discord: tnix: oh it would've been censored on meower lol
Snx: @tnix filter said no to whatever that was supposed to be xD
Snx: @tnix in what?
Discord: tnix: make them rewrite meower in brain****
JoshAtticus: lmao
Discord: theotherhades: just keep them away from java we don't want any suicidal monkeys
JoshAtticus: @tnix Yeah I know I pulled that patch to bettermeower, but the bug still occurs occasionally, it can be fixed by refreshing the page
Snx: @theotherhades i dont think monkeys are capable of coding
Snx: @theotherhades *wheeze*
Discord: theotherhades: just sell the server and use the money to buy monkeys to write code for us
Snx: @JoshAtticus ohhhhh well i am definitely on bettermeower but i am seeing things now so üëç
Discord: tnix: it'll be fixed with CL4 port
Discord: tnix: it's a bug with the server though, it sends packets in scratch format instead of js format
Discord: tnix: it's already been fixed on vanilla svelte
JoshAtticus: It's a bettermeower bug I don't know how to fix, although some people have the same bug on vanilla svelte.
Discord: theotherhades: ctrl+shift+r
Discord: tnix: recently there was a server bug that causes packets to not be sent in the proper format for svelte, this was fixed in a recent patch for svelte though
Discord: tnix: @Snx#0000 svelte or scratch?
Discord: tnix: @tnix * wasn't
Snx: @tnix i have to hit home to see any new posts
Discord: tnix: @Snx#0000 lmao, how
Discord: tnix: sorry, I was paying too much attention to the chat
Snx: @tnix my meower is very broken
Snx: @tnix hi'
Discord: tnix: hi snx
Snx: why nobody says hi to me
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 how so?
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus ?
Snx: hi
JoshAtticus: docs.meower.org is really unreliable at the moment
Discord: tnix: I think we got it because we wanted to make an r/place clone on thecommunity.ismakingsomething.cool
Discord: tnix: it was made when we were doing r/place
Bloctans: april fools~!!!!!
Bloctans: lol
JoshAtticus: ismakingsomething.cool expires on Sunday 2nd of April 2023
JoshAtticus: Although it's been 68
JoshAtticus: Can also be as little as 30 days
JoshAtticus: Varies between registars
JoshAtticus: It should exit the reactivation period around ~100-150 days after it expires
JoshAtticus: zed2345.com is currently in reactivation period
JoshAtticus: I manage domains for my parent's buisness, so that's how I know a lot about them
JoshAtticus: It will eventually go into reactivation period after expiring, before being released so anyone can reregister it
Discord: tnix: so other domains like ismakingsomething.cool and is-extremely.cool are locked on there too
Discord: tnix: but it got locked due to fraud detection after their mum did a chargeback or something
Discord: tnix: probably because they lost access to their registrar account (I forgot which registrar they used)
JoshAtticus: 68 days ago
JoshAtticus: zed2345.com
JoshAtticus: Oh yeah @zedthehedgehog your domain expired

Vetzla: @tnix it's realive? i guess?
Vetzla: i will promptly open the gates
tnix: so is sgerb actually dead or is it re-alived?
Vetzla: anyway thank you for hearing my cheeseburgers
Vetzla: and then he sold it to sgerb and told us "based"
Vetzla: like imagine if elon musk bought scratch and intentionally made it implode
Vetzla: and amazing
Vetzla: that would be hilarious
Vetzla: imagine if the scratch community rebels
Vetzla: im trna use stamp engine plus for meowstream but i cant get the text in front of the sprites
zedthehedgehog: sgerb berb boork:

sgerb requires user to be nice :sunglasses:
thank u for read
zedthehedgehog: @Vetzla lmao
zedthehedgehog: Amendments of sgerb
Vetzla: perfect
Vetzla: sgerb berb boork
zedthehedgehog: The declaration of sgerb
Vetzla: the sgerb berb boork
zedthehedgehog: @Vetzla here's some synonyms:
"Community Rules"
"Sgerb Code"
"Community Code"
"Code of Conduct"
"The laws of sgerb"
"Community Protocol"
"Sgerb Protocol"
tnix: anarchy server
Vetzla: the oldest
Vetzla: @Bloctans when i read the word fit i knew what was gonna happen
Vetzla: i will NEVER use the words "community guidelines" ever again
Bloctans: @Vetzla https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq-KxExV0MM
zedthehedgehog: *shivers* imagine an ST-run meower
zedthehedgehog: I hope that we don't turn into the ST
zedthehedgehog: @tnix yeah I mean that's true
zedthehedgehog: lmaoo
Vetzla: @zedthehedgehog the oldest anarchy server in sgerb
Vetzla: i think i have so many family friends i can find one
tnix: @Vetzla because it's mainly down to keeping a healthy community, most are owned by one person and can't moderate a community
zedthehedgehog: just no rules
zedthehedgehog: what about no mods
Vetzla: so we can say we aren't unmoderated chat
Vetzla: we should hire a professional moderator for a day to run sgerb
zedthehedgehog: fr
Vetzla: and i mean EVERY SINGLE ONE
Vetzla: why do all the scratch mods lack social features
zedthehedgehog: I mainly left scratch because I just lost interest and moved on, I mean after the forum shut down there was kind of no point
Vetzla: sgerb is like adacraft but with social features
Vetzla: i'm at the brink of leaving but i haven't because there aren't any other similar websites
zedthehedgehog: but stuff like that
zedthehedgehog: well not that in paticular as the sole reason
Vetzla: we should all collab on a rant project about scratch unrejecting username changes
zedthehedgehog: just one of the reasons I left scratch
zedthehedgehog: lmao fr
Vetzla: oh and their egos
Vetzla: i hate the forum helpers, they help expand the TOLORS and thats it
zedthehedgehog: lmao
Vetzla: imagine you make a suggestion that will change the course of scratch history for good and some random forumer asks "what purpose does this have" and it all goes crashing down
zedthehedgehog: can you please check discord
zedthehedgehog: hi tnix
Vetzla: i've made like 3 that havbeen rejected
tnix: @Bloctans it's not, yours is an IPv4 and his is IPv6, you will not be affected at all
Vetzla: my suggestion better not be rejected
Bloctans: i need it cuz i wanna know if its near my ip
Vetzla: i swear
Vetzla: fake body
Vetzla: its for educational purposes
Vetzla: can you dm me the other
Bloctans: tnix can you dm me part of roblox's ip
Vetzla: but ok
Vetzla: im not leaking my god dman ip
tnix: I'm going to try blocking their IP range, if anyone's IP gets blocked accidentally please DM me on the forums
