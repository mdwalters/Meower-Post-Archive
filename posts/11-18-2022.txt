Discord: tnix: ****, Discord delay
Discord: zedthehedgehog:  [image.png: https://go.meower.org/04f8b572]
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog onosecond
MDWalters124: @MDWalters124 and the person who i gave it back to said they don't know where it is
zedthehedgehog: you guys were one second apart
Discord: tnix: on Discord it doesn't appear that way
MDWalters124: i said it first
Discord: tnix: @zedthehedgehog#0000 yeah, cloudready
MDWalters124: cloudready
zedthehedgehog: I believe ChromeOS Flex was a continuation of something Neverware was doing before google acquired them
MDWalters124: welp, time to go grab a screwdriver and unplug the battery
MDWalters124: it keeps shutting down
zedthehedgehog: why did you return it in the first place?
MDWalters124: i regret returning mdwalters-laptop
zedthehedgehog: I feel bad for you
zedthehedgehog: ****
MDWalters124: yes

zedthehedgehog: a school chromebook?
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog ok https://u.cubeupload.com/MDWalters/EZxbwt.png
MDWalters124: ok
zedthehedgehog: https://chromeenterprise.google/os/chromeosflex/
Discord: tnix: "uh... this is chromeos flex"
MDWalters124: https://u.cubeupload.com/MDWalters/VB8xRe.png
zedthehedgehog: chromeos flex
MDWalters124: @tnix what
zedthehedgehog: yeah
Discord: tnix: and he's using ChromeOS flex, why not just use linux and not chromeos
MDWalters124: yeah
zedthehedgehog: ever heard of crouton?
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 you can have a linux machine
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 imagine using chromeos
MDWalters124: anyway, back to writing gocial server...
MDWalters124: ok
Discord: theotherhades: why so many tabs üíÄ
MDWalters124: uh... this is chromeos flex :thumbsup: https://u.cubeupload.com/MDWalters/NIx5hD.png
MDWalters124: i don't own a chromebook
Discord: tnix: mongodb atlas is their cloud version and you can use it on replit
MDWalters124: @theotherhades social media
MDWalters124: i don't have a linux laptop
MDWalters124: @tnix nah
Discord: theotherhades: what even is gocial
Discord: tnix: or use something like mongodb atlas, mongodb atlas is free for 512mb of data
Discord: theotherhades: if you're gonna use replit use replitdb instead of json files
Discord: tnix: *at least
MDWalters124: ok
Discord: tnix: and you should not store your db in a single json file, and you should raise the bcrypt salt rounds to at 12 or 14
MDWalters124: @bcrypt cool hashing
MDWalters124: @tnix all i see is "mdwalters": "sdkghfkhsdgfkdgfkhsdkghskadhgksdgvhdgvkadbvkhadgbndzxbvn,bvjkhsdgfjdgvvfjdfvjdbhj"
Discord: tnix: replit still has it public
MDWalters124: i didn't publish it
Discord: tnix:  [image.png: https://go.meower.org/eed01df0]
Discord: tnix: from what I can see you have the db public, which is bad, and you're using bcrypt with a low salt rounds of 10
