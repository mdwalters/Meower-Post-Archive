axestudios: Lol imagine selling the design to tesla and the rename it to Tesla screen
axestudios: Of course, the only problem is affording to create a tiny circuit with liquid crystals carefully placed on top
axestudios: I plan on calling it liquid crystal paper
axestudios: Ez photoshop
Discord: theotherhades: i could cut it up and say i have dual monitors
Discord: theotherhades: i would buy it
axestudios: @theotherhades basically a really bendy monitor that feels like paper
Discord: theotherhades: i have no idea what that is
axestudios: I just decided to design a flexible reflective LCD paper textured display
axestudios: @theotherhades lmao
Discord: theotherhades: I'm markiplier
axestudios: Hi guys
Bloctans: gn
JoshAtticus: will not let me merge any branch except master into bettermeower
JoshAtticus: github loves being a pain
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus theres a couple issues with 1.5 that i dont wanna fix and i dont think can fix but go for it
Discord: theotherhades: write the svelte code manually into bettermeower
JoshAtticus: How do I merge a branch from svelte into a branch on bettermeower
JoshAtticus: I'm gonna get to work on BetterMeower 1.5
JoshAtticus: It's driving me insane so I'm gonna refresh
JoshAtticus: I now get 2 notifications for every message
JoshAtticus: Otherwise the notifications multiply
JoshAtticus: Oh hey @m I found an issue with your notifications.js thing, you need to initialise it once the website loads, not every time someone logs in
JoshAtticus: But spinning grey meowy on bettermeower
JoshAtticus: Why does theotherhades have spinning text as a pfp on vanilla?
JoshAtticus: Cool
Discord: tnix: prod worked, I'm going to remove the gh action now since it isn't really needed anymore
Discord: theotherhades: lmao
JoshAtticus: It feels weird telling tnix how to do something, when it's usually tnix telling me how to do something
JoshAtticus: Alright
Discord: tnix: it's doing it on the master branch now, it should work
JoshAtticus: Did you remember to add the commands and variable?
Discord: tnix: so I need to delete the current prod deployment and remake it
JoshAtticus: They are counted as two completely different things to cloudflare
Discord: tnix: I did, but I also changed the branch from gh-pages to master
JoshAtticus: You need to add variables to both the preview and production things
Discord: tnix: prod didn't work
JoshAtticus: Nice this dev build
Discord: tnix: re-deploying prod now
Discord: tnix: it worked, nice
Discord: tnix: hopefully it works, I'm testing it on bloctan's branch first
JoshAtticus: yes
Discord: tnix: do I put that in the env variables?
JoshAtticus: After I figured out you needed to add the NODE_VERSION variable, it literally took me 4 minutes to move to cloudflare from gh pages
Discord: tnix: we will probably switch to cf building soon, as long as CST approves of it
JoshAtticus: Well it isn't that hard to move to cf pages
JoshAtticus: WHY IS SPOT BLOCKED
Discord: tnix: because it was setup like that for gh pages, but then we switched to cf
JoshAtticus: Building on cloudflare is super fast, and more simple because it's all in one s****
JoshAtticus: Why though?
Discord: tnix: we don't build on cloudflare, github builds and then is deployed on cf
JoshAtticus: Literally feels like it's been forever since I last used any form of code dev tool on this laptop, because i've been using github.dev and codespaces for the past 2 months.
JoshAtticus: Otherwise the preview branches will not work
JoshAtticus: @tnix, you need to add the NODE_VERSION = 17 enviroment variable and build commands/outputs to preview branches on Cloudflare
Bloctans: check pull
JoshAtticus: I get a white screen
JoshAtticus: Why can't I open Svelte 1.5 dev preview?
Vetzla: m
Vetzla: n
Vetzla: a
Vetzla: d
Vetzla: it filters **** but it doesn't filter
Vetzla: btw that was daxmn
Vetzla: **** shouldve asked him for the links
Vetzla: yeah, and the owner of that part of my object show history refuses to share it
Discord: tnix: it's good for privacy, but sad to see such an old exploit go away
Discord: tnix: yeah, scratch started requiring project tokens a few days ago
Vetzla: and now i cant cuz half of it's unshared
Vetzla: i was trying to uncover my old object show history using turbowarp
Vetzla: well well well, today we say goodbye to unshared projects
Bloctans: because of how i made images, there is an issue where if you send a 1x4096 image (now 4096x1) it sorta breaks home
Discord: tnix: what
Bloctans: can you somehow figure out how i can fix the issue where i can send a 1x4096 px or 4096x1 image and for the home to break
Discord: tnix: and you basically just take all the attachments from an array on the message object, no regex
Snx: ill be back in a few
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 yeah, the images thing should be fixed in b6 since you will only need to allow one hostname
Bloctans: you = tnix
Bloctans: also with cst and you helping less im kinda at a lost cause
Snx: @tnix *casually doesnt speak computer science* uh yeah i have no idea what you mean
Bloctans: @tnix its not that, its because i dont understand regex and am adding features the client doesnt fully support
Discord: tnix: we'll probably need to do a big refactor for svelte for b6, just because the code quality has gone down and more and more bugs are showing with it
Snx: (yeah ik this is coming from the person who is notorious for not being able to code but i want to be encouraging)
Bloctans: actually like 90%
Bloctans: 25% of the bugs i cant fix needing fixing
Bloctans: bugs everywhere, half i cant fix
Snx: @Bloctans dont give up!
Bloctans: i cant deal with this
Bloctans: im about to give up on svelte
Bloctans: @tnix if i allowed meower.org then go.meower.org would be allowed
Bloctans: i could not **** it from the post content
Bloctans: since i have to remove the embed image text after rendering the post
Bloctans: issue 2 is impossible for me
Bloctans: @tnix ok i fixed issue 1 (sorta), there is another issue that comes along with it that i wont and will never fix because idk how to
Bloctans: the scrolling modals is an issue with image sizing, idk how to really fix that without allowing for exploiting the system
Bloctans: how am i supposed to reset a post's content without messing up the rendering
Bloctans: im not fixing either
Bloctans: i give up
Bloctans: @tnix ill fix issue 2 but not one ):
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 well, having bugs is not ideal, so it probably won't be merged until fixed
Snx: remember when i was cat block
Bloctans: issue 1 idk how to fix
issue 2 is because of the way i added images
Discord: tnix: hey
Snx: hi
Discord: williamhorning: smh
Discord: tnix: and images break within modals [image.png: https://go.meower.org/5734f578]
tnix: it should, just not on go.meower.org or other links that redirect
tnix: so meower.org doesn't work at all
tnix: [imagetest2.png: https://u.cubeupload.com/tnix100/a.png]
tnix: [imagetest.png: https://meower.org/assets/meowerlogo-white.svg]
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans why are you able to scroll on modals in 1.5? [image.png: https://go.meower.org/78e2801d]
JoshAtticus: I'll be gone for about and hour, bye
JoshAtticus: btw the xml sitemap doesn't contain any site info, so we'll need a second script to go through the links and get their metadata
JoshAtticus: nooooooooo github started rate limiting me
JoshAtticus: It uses the XML sitemap standard
JoshAtticus: In an XML sitemap
Bloctans: how is the indexed sites stored
Bloctans: uh
JoshAtticus: **7
JoshAtticus: Oh yeah each core has an average speed of 8 urls scanned per second
JoshAtticus: how
Bloctans: *indexs
Bloctans: ok you should make a search engine using the idexes tbh
JoshAtticus: That's almost 100 iPhone 4's
JoshAtticus: of 2010 tech
JoshAtticus: eleven, thousand, dollars
JoshAtticus: It's a computer worth around US$150 in today, but cost my dad almost A$11000 back in 2010
JoshAtticus: not proccessor
JoshAtticus: **server
JoshAtticus: This intel xeon in my processor has 24
JoshAtticus: It is running on 16 cores
Bloctans: 2 weeks and 100000 github repos???
JoshAtticus: It also found my Github profile and bettermeower yesterday too
JoshAtticus: almost 2 weeks
Bloctans: how long has it been running
JoshAtticus: From which it also got the Meower website
JoshAtticus: It found the Meower Twitter and Discord from Github
JoshAtticus: @Bloctans Github, Twitter and Discord
JoshAtticus: So only 3
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus how did it find meower tho
JoshAtticus: Oh wait indirectly from bing.com
JoshAtticus: It's seen the Meower website 4 times, from github.com, twitter.com, discord.com, and bing.com, I never knew it uses bing to find sites
Bloctans: how does google reindex over a billion documents
JoshAtticus: Wow it found the Meower website yesterday
JoshAtticus: @Bloctans I don't know how, I just like sitemaps, although if you made a frontend and backend, I could do the crawling
JoshAtticus: It's set to go 100% performance at night when no one is using internet, and 25% during the day
Bloctans: you should use that indexed data to create a search engine
JoshAtticus: So not a problem
JoshAtticus: But we have unlimited data
JoshAtticus: And it uses around 19GB of data a week
Bloctans: you could make your own search engine with the indexer
JoshAtticus: I leave the crawler running 24/7 on my server
JoshAtticus: from github.com
JoshAtticus: Just checked
JoshAtticus: Oh wait it's currently at 73,934
JoshAtticus: And it keeps growing
Bloctans: wow
JoshAtticus: That's over 50,000 websites currently being scanned
JoshAtticus: It has also started scanning over 50,000 off links
Bloctans: what would be a good site to start indexing from
JoshAtticus: And it's still growing
JoshAtticus: Github's sitemap is over 100MB
Bloctans: no i wanna make my own indexer
JoshAtticus: I have saved over 1,000,000 github links since 2 weeks ago
JoshAtticus: That creates XML sitemaps
JoshAtticus: I have a site crawler
JoshAtticus: I can do indexing
JoshAtticus: base it off of the remnants of meower web
Bloctans: i wanna make my own search engine
JoshAtticus: Oh yeah I'm gonna run that Meower post archive thing

kjhgfd: @kjhgfd hi
Roblox888i: @kjhgfd hi bro
helloitsme: @tnix it worked
kjhgfd: my bother said he is coming
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @Tnix (NZDT) I found out why the sound effects option has not been working at all [image.png: https://go.meower.org/d727a2fd]
Bloctans: @tnix https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Svelte/pull/45
helloitsme: @tnix ok
kjhgfd: come in my gc
tnix: if it works, then it's the Python shell
tnix: @helloitsme try doing print("hello")
helloitsme: @tnix i don’t know if I’m in terminal or python shell
tnix: @zedthehedgehog no, CL3 scratch clients
zedthehedgehog: *as in
zedthehedgehog: @tnix Legacy clients are in old cached versions of Meower Svelte?
MDWalters124: NOBODY USE A LEGACY CLIENT
tnix: @MDWalters124 yeah, the server does that, it's because of people using legacy clients and the server getting confused, that is gonna be fixed in CL4 port
helloitsme: If I’m in shell or terminal
helloitsme: @tnix idk
MDWalters124: lmao even meower svelte is suffering from string bug
kjhgfd: he said ok
zedthehedgehog: In which we could take action.
tnix: @zedthehedgehog no, but it is spam, just please stop doing it @Roblox888i
zedthehedgehog: Though if it continues, it could be considered spam
tnix: @helloitsme are you in the Python shell or a normal terminal?
zedthehedgehog: I don't believe adding to sus group chats is really a bannable offense
helloitsme: @tnix Syntax error: invalid syntax is what I get when I use pip install cloudlink 
MDWalters124: it's slow
tnix: https://u.cubeupload.com/tnix100/a.png
MDWalters124: hello from onworks
zedthehedgehog: Oh.
kjhgfd: BAD BROTHER
tnix: @Roblox888i I now have console logs of you adding me to a group chat and immediately deleting it lmao
MDWalters124: i'm try onworks to see console
Bloctans: i found out how to apply a transformation matrix to a pygame surface
tnix: @MDWalters124 there might be a way to see posts in the group chat even if it's deleted, but Mike would need to do it
zedthehedgehog: @helloitsme Oh.
MDWalters124: wait
helloitsme: @tnix Something to do with File “<stdn>”
MDWalters124: roblox888i be playing with us
zedthehedgehog: if "install" is the error you need to exit Python.
MDWalters124: @tnix rip
tnix: @MDWalters124 sadly not really, since when a group chat is deleted it's deleted from the db
kjhgfd: i found kfc recipe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTABK8Il4Ko
MDWalters124: if that helps
MDWalters124: uh i found a deleted id from mdwalters125 logs: 1a1033e9-4be9-4c19-9ddc-0ed86bf7ab03, 0be63a56-319f-4c5e-86cc-ec3907a47700
tnix: what OS are you on btw?
helloitsme: @tnix hang on I’m gonna find it
tnix: what's the error?
helloitsme: @tnix didn’t work
tnix: @helloitsme pip install cloudlink
helloitsme: How do I use pip to install cloudlink I forgot the command
zedthehedgehog: For whatever reason
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 That won't happen anytime soon, unless HTML5 is deprecated in some way.
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog what happens when scratch 4.0
helloitsme: @zedthehedgehog exactly 
kjhgfd: ok
zedthehedgehog: Cloudlink is a free and open-source, websocket-powered API optimized for Scratch 3.0.
kjhgfd: ok
helloitsme: @kjhgfd it has to do with servers and the cloud
helloitsme: @kjhgfd something
kjhgfd: ik some coding from my bro
kjhgfd: what is cloudlink
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 Oh.
helloitsme: I’m gonna go make some cloudlink test thing idk
MDWalters124: You have been added to the group chat 'MD BAD'!
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 I concur.
MDWalters124: and acts smart all the time
MDWalters124: kkjahfkgahfgashfgajs is annoying

kjhgfd: not my bro
kjhgfd: oh you talking about roblox.com
kjhgfd: @tnix you doomed us all
tnix: @kjhgfd roblox.com's IP is 128.116.114.3, there you go
MDWalters124: rip
helloitsme: @MDWalters124 mobile
MDWalters124: @helloitsme ctrl+shift+i
helloitsme: Guys I just got a new gc
tnix: @kjhgfd ipv6 is just saying the version of the IP address, it's not an actual IP lol
zedthehedgehog: I don't understand how that is related to roblox
kjhgfd: is it the same for my brother
helloitsme: I have a new gc
zedthehedgehog: IPv6 Is Internet Protocol Version 6
helloitsme: That*
MDWalters124: can you read
kjhgfd: is it ipv6
helloitsme: @kjhgfd why would you ask thay
zedthehedgehog: @kjhgfd What?
helloitsme: @kjhgfd …
kjhgfd: what is roblox ip
zedthehedgehog: It is against moderator policy
zedthehedgehog: Meower never will reveal IPs ever
helloitsme: @kjhgfd bruh what
zedthehedgehog: @kjhgfd I was not planning to do so
kjhgfd: i dont wanna get kidnapped
yourmother: @kjhgfd L bozo idk what that command is
kjhgfd: dont revel my ip
zedthehedgehog: Your IP is IPv6, which means it is unlikely for you to be Roblox888i's brother unless you are using the same device
kjhgfd: i just saw his user now
kjhgfd: im his brother
MDWalters124: how would you know who is roblox888i then?
kjhgfd: so i didnt knew
kjhgfd: I never saw his user
zedthehedgehog: Instead of asking who they are
zedthehedgehog: @kjhgfd Then you would know who Roblox888i is
MDWalters124: roblox888i: professional liar
kjhgfd: i am his brother
kjhgfd: i just started meower
tnix: @MDWalters124 rip
zedthehedgehog: According to your IP
MDWalters124: netlog moment
kjhgfd: no
MDWalters124: @tnix no according to logs rip
zedthehedgehog: @kjhgfd You
kjhgfd: who is roblox888i
zedthehedgehog: It has come to my attention that "kjhgfd" is Roblox888i
tnix: yeah, if mdwalters125 was added to the chats
MDWalters124: @tnix would scrolling through mdwalters125 logs help
zedthehedgehog: @kjhgfd A tab in Inspect Element that allows you to see JavaScript logs
kjhgfd: what is console
MDWalters124: not me
tnix: if anyone is on a browser where they can open the console, go through some events of chat states (that aren't 101) and show the users in them
zedthehedgehog: Unfortunately, I will not be able to ban Roblox888i because of the suspicion that Roblox888i may be creating such chats.
kjhgfd: im new
