m: NOW PORT ITUNES TO LINUX IT'S NOT THAT HARD
m: me: sorry guys i have ubuntu
JoshAtticus: It doesn't go into recovery mode either
JoshAtticus: No, they said "Alright, can I get you to restore your device using iTunes on a Windows PC"
Discord: tnix: otherwise they would say to just do it through settings, but iTunes would allow you to backup the device
Discord: tnix: probably making you back it up first then restore
JoshAtticus: I HAVE PERSONAL DATA ON THERE
JoshAtticus: WHY
JoshAtticus: They want me to restore my device
Bloctans: @ShowierData9978 restart the bot to apply that cors thing @ShowierData9978 restart the bot to apply that cors thing @ShowierData9978 restart the bot to apply that cors thing
Discord: tnix: say you don't have a PC/laptop lol
JoshAtticus: How do I tell them I am a Linux user
JoshAtticus: I don't have that either
JoshAtticus: Yeah, now they are trying to get me to use iTunes on a Windows PC
Discord: tnix: that's what I did when they asked about my mac's battery the other day, which was true, I didn't have access to it right then
m: tell them "i'm sorry uwu"
Bloctans: @ShowierData9978 restart the bot to apply that cors thing
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 just tell them you don't have access to the mac right now
JoshAtticus: I'll just tell them I lost the charger, always works
m: "i accidentally bought a mac"
JoshAtticus: How do I explain that to Apple?
m: @JoshAtticus they lied about privacy never trust anything that claims it's privacy friendly except for meower products
JoshAtticus: So his mac is appearing on my account :laugh:
JoshAtticus: That's right, my friend used my Apple ID to sideload an app
m: @m *only for devices released yesterday
JoshAtticus: Oh wait they can see my apple id devices
Discord: tnix: oh ok, because if you were under apple care they would only replace it if it was UNDER 80% health
JoshAtticus: Now they're telling me to plug it into the mac I definitely have
Bloctans: @ShowierData9978 restart the bot to apply that cros thing
JoshAtticus: @tnix no
m: apple cares*
JoshAtticus: They keep asking me to enroll my device in diagnostics mode, but it WON'T EVEN TURN ON
Discord: tnix: is it under apple care?
JoshAtticus: Mine says 80% and says it works fine
m: @JoshAtticus they were wrong it's 0%
Discord: tnix: stuck at 0% and shows "Service Recommended"
Vetzla: my new iphone batter has had 100% battery life since i've put the new battery
Discord: tnix: and my problem was the battery was completely dead, not low health
JoshAtticus: Well 3uTools says it has 13% health
Discord: tnix: well I think I contacted them after selecting the device, so probably didn't need my Apple ID and serial number because of that
JoshAtticus: lmao
m: *0%
JoshAtticus: (it has 80% health)
JoshAtticus: They needed that to see my battery health details
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 huh, they didn't need any of that to ask about a battery replacement for a macbook
m: @JoshAtticus since you won't say uwu, then i will
JoshAtticus: I contacted Apple yesterday, and they needed my Apple ID, serial number, analytics data, bluetooth access, just to tell me my phone which lasts 16 seconds on battery IS PERFECTLY FINE
Bloctans: @tnix i put the flask-cors thing into the source and showier said that he pulled it and fixed it
Discord: tnix: ask ShowierData to allow it
Discord: tnix: ask ShowierData to allow it
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 webhooks.meower.org hasn't allow CORS

ShowierData9978: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSAllowOriginNotMatchingOrigin
Snx: @Roblox888i it does in fact work
Vetzla: maybe its like video ids or something
Vetzla: cool but i have no idea what it dodes

NOOOO
Snx: man i think streameow is better
Roblox888i: i did a video id test
Vetzla: @JoshAtticus cool
Roblox888i: hi
JoshAtticus: I can do nightly packaging for any new updates and create a GitHub org
Vetzla: btw meowstream is going to be partially offline
Vetzla: yeah
JoshAtticus: Oh, you should probably host it like a packaged turbowarp project, because scratch has 4:3 ratio, 30 fps, and scratch team, as well as a 35MB limit on code
Vetzla: https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32392453/
Vetzla: anyway im gonna make a studio
JoshAtticus: meowstream
Vetzla: nah, we're using scratch
JoshAtticus: Do you have a GitHub org?
Vetzla: ok you pick, streameower or meowstream
JoshAtticus: yay
Vetzla: sure
JoshAtticus: I can design the UI
JoshAtticus: also can i help?
JoshAtticus: meowstream
ShowierData9978: it works for CORS now
