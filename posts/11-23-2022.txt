JoshAtticus: oh hey it's finally lunch break bye
JoshAtticus: nope, broke after posting
JoshAtticus: bruh after refreshing it works
Discord: ShowierData9978: too
Discord: ShowierData9978: to lazy, and im on mobile
JoshAtticus: oh but can't you just click the link
Discord: ShowierData9978: so it would show up on discord
Discord: tnix: it didn't embed on discord
JoshAtticus: why did you repost my link

Discord: ShowierData9978: of
Discord: ShowierData9978: bc that was testing with meower desktop (svelte compiled with tori), that does not scale well with alot off it open
Discord: tnix: well, Meower used to run on a pi and handled more than 8 users online, so probably more than 7-8 bots
Discord: ShowierData9978: actually probably more
Discord: ShowierData9978: my pi can hold 7-8 bots on it probably
Discord: tnix: I just realized, @Meower Robot has been hosted in 3 different places, my server, Azure, and now Mike's server
Discord: tnix: ah
Discord: ShowierData9978: the others are on replit
Discord: ShowierData9978: only webhooks is on my pi
Discord: ShowierData9978: nope
Discord: ShowierData9978: nooe
JoshAtticus: @tnix It only works sometimes on Windows
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 are they all on the same Pi?
JoshAtticus: Because linux always stuffs it up, and then I have to run uefi recovery
Discord: ShowierData9978: they are right next to each other
Discord: tnix: do you have Windows to test if it works within Windows?
JoshAtticus: I just have a small Windows 10 partition to install UEFI updates
Discord: ShowierData9978: 3 bots of mine are online
JoshAtticus: It stopped working after that update
JoshAtticus: Got a UEFI update a few days ago actually
Discord: theotherhades: @ShowierData9978 🤨
JoshAtticus: UEFI
JoshAtticus: It's a 2020 laptop I bought in 2021
Discord: ShowierData9978: all of my bots are snuggling
Discord: tnix: how old?
JoshAtticus: HP
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 what kind of trackpad is it?
JoshAtticus: Why does 2 finger scrolling on my trackpad not work with ubuntu?
Discord: ShowierData9978: he acts like a bot with his uptime
JoshAtticus: Lmao
Discord: tnix: also bloctans logged back in lol
JoshAtticus: Discord, MDBot, Webhooks, CodeBot, APIBot, PenguinBot, JoshAtticus, Bloctans, yourmother
Discord: ShowierData9978: send ulist
MDBot: MDBot was online since 6 hours ago.
JoshAtticus: ~uptime
JoshAtticus: lower = longer time online
JoshAtticus: wow 9/9 place on logon
Discord: tnix: and then stopped again
Discord: tnix: it was working a few days ago
yourmother: yourmother entered the chat
Discord: ShowierData9978: i have not gotten a single reaction
Discord: tnix: Discord have some quite harsh reaction ratelimits
Discord: ShowierData9978: oh, ok
JoshAtticus: Every course costs like A$75
Discord: tnix: I think Mike's being reaction ratelimited
JoshAtticus: I wish I could learn to code properly, but I don't know where to start
Discord: tnix: it is enabled
Discord: ShowierData9978: atleast in home
Discord: ShowierData9978: btw, can you renable the reactions its really usefull
Discord: tnix: but then you can't really do anything with the user's account, you're just verifying who they are
JoshAtticus: I would work on Meower development but I am awful at anything that's not HTML, Svelte or CSS
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 nah, it only ever sends a token that was generated by the bot to the bot
JoshAtticus: **token
Discord: tnix: I said somewhere in another channel that after CL4 port is done, and within free time while I'm not working on rewrite I would work on OAuth2
JoshAtticus: ****n
JoshAtticus: It sends your username and password instead of a OAuth2 ****n
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 kind of, but it won't be secure or as easy as proper OAuth2 implement
Discord: ShowierData9978: bridge
Discord: ShowierData9978: we alr do it with the bridgr
JoshAtticus: post editing wen eta
JoshAtticus: **sleep
JoshAtticus: I got woken up 4 times last night due to thunder and rain, but still got 10 hours and 17 minutes of slee[
Discord: ShowierData9978: without modifying the server
Discord: ShowierData9978: tech oauth is possible currently
JoshAtticus: @Bloctans good night!
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 gn
JoshAtticus: "Everyone is welcome to use Meower." except roblox
Bloctans: gn for the final time
Discord: tnix: but some, like the OAuth flow hasn't been touched since like May [image.png: https://go.meower.org/413a5dfc]
JoshAtticus: But figma doesn't give you the source code unless you pay for premium
Bloctans: yeah is stopped working on it a while ago
Discord: tnix: at least not the code on gh, the designs have been changed a bit within figma
Discord: tnix: yeah
JoshAtticus: New b6 design hasn't been touched in 3 months though
JoshAtticus: Yeah
Discord: tnix: I love b6 website design too, at least your design is better than the old one that was really needing an update
JoshAtticus: I only made my rushed design because I hated the old one so much
JoshAtticus: I really hope it replaces my awful rushed design
JoshAtticus: I love b6 website design
Discord: tnix: so take a lot of the styling from your b6 svelte
Discord: tnix: instead of b5 design
Discord: tnix: depth design language
Bloctans: also gn
Bloctans: @tnix wdym new design language
Discord: tnix: (rewriting svelte to fix up code, get new design language, switch to sveltekit so we can have routing, and a few other things)
JoshAtticus: How far away is that?
Bloctans: ok gn
JoshAtticus: @tnix Woohoo!
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 yeah
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 CL4 port will have user sync like b6 was going to have, you will be able to store whatever you'd like for bettermeower
Bloctans: @tnix rewrite the main js and some html? try and keep the css the same?
JoshAtticus: I want to add custom themes to BetterMeower but I really think it needs to be stored on the server, no body wants to have to set their custom theme on all of their devices one-by-one.
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 yeah, for release we will probably rewrite svelte but use a lot of the design stuff you made for b6
Discord: ShowierData9978: where its forced to write to a specific file, if the user says otherwise stdout
Discord: tnix: with custom themes
Bloctans: half done
Bloctans: cuz i have a branch with the orange design
Bloctans: good
Bloctans: ok
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 orange
Discord: ShowierData9978: i also made cl logging alot better
Discord: ShowierData9978: im saying i also fixed it bot side
Bloctans: will we use the orange design or zed's more grayish design
Discord: ShowierData9978: ye, ik
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 it was actually bots that use CL3 extension on Scratch
Discord: ShowierData9978: bots are the problem, but i fixed it it 2.0.0
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 the beta 6 designs
Discord: tnix: and will be fixed server-side in CL4 port
Bloctans: what is the new depth design
Discord: tnix: you can still use it, svelte.meower.org and app.meower.org have got a patch
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 no, it's not
JoshAtticus: @axestudios CloudLink 3 is banned for all bots due to causing issues with Meower Servers
JoshAtticus: https://wiki.meower.org/wiki/Release_1
Discord: RoboMeowy: ???
axestudios: @RoboMeowy /j
Discord: RoboMeowy: ???
axestudios: @RoboMeowy WHAT? HOW? WHEN? WHERE? WHO? WHY?
Discord: RoboMeowy: a, what
axestudios: @JoshAtticus .....so what is this "banned" version?
JoshAtticus: ok
axestudios: @JoshAtticus I'm gonna read some more meower wiki....
JoshAtticus: because i wanted to make a version of dangoOS embedded that runs a meower bot
JoshAtticus: so it's not the banned version
JoshAtticus: oh ok good
axestudios: @JoshAtticus Care Loving Tender
JoshAtticus: that you load into your browser with a code injector
JoshAtticus: scratch extension
JoshAtticus: no meowerbot scratch has an extension
axestudios: @JoshAtticus there's a new extension for meower bots?
JoshAtticus: also what version of cloudlink does meowerbot scratch use again?
JoshAtticus: Make something that uses a scratch editor, but uses cloudlink turbo instead of cloudlink 3
axestudios: Hmm ima try making a bot client that has a gui kinda like Microsoft windows
JoshAtticus: Usually yourmother is at place 2
JoshAtticus: Oh yeah I had to reset it because of internet, but it still got to 2/10
MDBot: MDBot was online since 5 hours ago.
JoshAtticus: ~uptime
JoshAtticus: **better
JoshAtticus: lower is betteer
JoshAtticus: Discord is 1/10
JoshAtticus: But move down when someone else does it
JoshAtticus: Because you move up when you log off and back on
axestudios: @RoboMeowy RoboMeowy#9999
