Bloctans: im like the best one who knows html online rn ):
tnix: @Bloctans oh, maybe ask CST or someone who knows HTML a bit better
Bloctans: before i used em, but it was entirely unresponsive with svelte
Bloctans: @tnix what i mean is that the container for the messages wont properly scale and be slightly non-sync with the screen when using vh
--snxwleopxrd: *exists*
Bloctans: (sorry for the grammar issues, typign in a white box is hard)
tnix: @Bloctans what's wrong with them?
--snxwleopxrd: playing fireboy and watergirl...by myself due to my lack of friends
Bloctans: ok but what about the size issues for the inner container that will be holding the messages in bes in rel 1
--snxwleopxrd: @tnix thats alright xD
tnix: @--snxwleopxrd hi snx, sorry for not saying hi
tnix: you can apparently use stuff like filter and fill in CSS to change it
--snxwleopxrd: everyone is too busy talking about meower development to say hi to me i guess
Bloctans: check the designs
tnix: @Bloctans wdym change the icons based on the color?
Bloctans: for the beta 6 designs, i wanna make it so that the icons are like the beta 5 icons since idk how to change color of icons based on the the color, also for the home inner container i cant seem to make it properly scale
--snxwleopxrd: hi
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 huh?
Bloctans: for the icons, i wanna keep it like normal beta 5 since it feels impossible to change the icons colors based on the theme
Bloctans: tnix can you help me

Discord: tnix: it's usually integrated within the REST API itself and you just go to like https://api.meower.org/docs or whatever
Discord: tnix:  [image.png: https://go.meower.org/135c4c01]
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification
JoshAtticus: @tnix What's OpenAPI?
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades you would need an acc to edit before I changed it
Discord: tnix: Btw, I will probably use openapi for CL4 port, and we will hopefully continue to use it for release
Discord: theotherhades: i got into it just fine without one lol
JoshAtticus: oh you'll need an account, I will make it so you don't for now
Discord: theotherhades: this kind of stuff, in super **** plain html lol [image.png: https://go.meower.org/2b414721]
Discord: theotherhades: i wrote a bit on the api for https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Server/issues/119 but got bored lol

Discord: ShowierData9978: of
Discord: ShowierData9978: bc that was testing with meower desktop (svelte compiled with tori), that does not scale well with alot off it open
Discord: tnix: well, Meower used to run on a pi and handled more than 8 users online, so probably more than 7-8 bots
Discord: ShowierData9978: actually probably more
Discord: ShowierData9978: my pi can hold 7-8 bots on it probably
Discord: tnix: I just realized, @Meower Robot has been hosted in 3 different places, my server, Azure, and now Mike's server
Discord: tnix: ah
Discord: ShowierData9978: the others are on replit
Discord: ShowierData9978: only webhooks is on my pi
Discord: ShowierData9978: nope
Discord: ShowierData9978: nooe
JoshAtticus: @tnix It only works sometimes on Windows
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 are they all on the same Pi?
JoshAtticus: Because linux always stuffs it up, and then I have to run uefi recovery
Discord: ShowierData9978: they are right next to each other
Discord: tnix: do you have Windows to test if it works within Windows?
JoshAtticus: I just have a small Windows 10 partition to install UEFI updates
Discord: ShowierData9978: 3 bots of mine are online
JoshAtticus: It stopped working after that update
Discord: theotherhades: @ShowierData9978 🤨
JoshAtticus: Got a UEFI update a few days ago actually
JoshAtticus: UEFI
JoshAtticus: It's a 2020 laptop I bought in 2021
Discord: ShowierData9978: all of my bots are snuggling
Discord: tnix: how old?
JoshAtticus: HP
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 what kind of trackpad is it?
JoshAtticus: Why does 2 finger scrolling on my trackpad not work with ubuntu?

Discord: tnix: it was working a few days ago

Discord: ShowierData9978: i have not gotten a single reaction
Discord: tnix: Discord have some quite harsh reaction ratelimits
JoshAtticus: Every course costs like A$75
Discord: ShowierData9978: oh, ok
Discord: tnix: I think Mike's being reaction ratelimited
JoshAtticus: I wish I could learn to code properly, but I don't know where to start
Discord: tnix: it is enabled
Discord: ShowierData9978: atleast in home
Discord: ShowierData9978: btw, can you renable the reactions its really usefull
Discord: tnix: but then you can't really do anything with the user's account, you're just verifying who they are
JoshAtticus: I would work on Meower development but I am awful at anything that's not HTML, Svelte or CSS
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 nah, it only ever sends a token that was generated by the bot to the bot
JoshAtticus: **token
Discord: tnix: I said somewhere in another channel that after CL4 port is done, and within free time while I'm not working on rewrite I would work on OAuth2
JoshAtticus: ****n
JoshAtticus: It sends your username and password instead of a OAuth2 ****n
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 kind of, but it won't be secure or as easy as proper OAuth2 implement

Discord: ShowierData9978: we alr do it with the bridgr
JoshAtticus: post editing wen eta
JoshAtticus: **sleep
JoshAtticus: I got woken up 4 times last night due to thunder and rain, but still got 10 hours and 17 minutes of slee[
Discord: ShowierData9978: without modifying the server
Discord: ShowierData9978: tech oauth is possible currently
JoshAtticus: @Bloctans good night!
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 gn
JoshAtticus: "Everyone is welcome to use Meower." except roblox
Bloctans: gn for the final time
Discord: tnix: but some, like the OAuth flow hasn't been touched since like May [image.png: https://go.meower.org/413a5dfc]
JoshAtticus: But figma doesn't give you the source code unless you pay for premium
Bloctans: yeah is stopped working on it a while ago
Discord: tnix: at least not the code on gh, the designs have been changed a bit within figma
Discord: tnix: yeah
JoshAtticus: New b6 design hasn't been touched in 3 months though
JoshAtticus: Yeah
Discord: tnix: I love b6 website design too, at least your design is better than the old one that was really needing an update
JoshAtticus: I only made my rushed design because I hated the old one so much
JoshAtticus: I really hope it replaces my awful rushed design
JoshAtticus: I love b6 website design
Discord: tnix: so take a lot of the styling from your b6 svelte
Discord: tnix: instead of b5 design
Discord: tnix: depth design language
Bloctans: also gn
Bloctans: @tnix wdym new design language
Discord: tnix: (rewriting svelte to fix up code, get new design language, switch to sveltekit so we can have routing, and a few other things)
JoshAtticus: How far away is that?
Bloctans: ok gn
JoshAtticus: @tnix Woohoo!
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 yeah
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 CL4 port will have user sync like b6 was going to have, you will be able to store whatever you'd like for bettermeower
Bloctans: @tnix rewrite the main js and some html? try and keep the css the same?
JoshAtticus: I want to add custom themes to BetterMeower but I really think it needs to be stored on the server, no body wants to have to set their custom theme on all of their devices one-by-one.
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 yeah, for release we will probably rewrite svelte but use a lot of the design stuff you made for b6
Discord: ShowierData9978: where its forced to write to a specific file, if the user says otherwise stdout
Discord: tnix: with custom themes
Bloctans: half done
Bloctans: cuz i have a branch with the orange design
Bloctans: good
Bloctans: ok
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 orange
Discord: ShowierData9978: i also made cl logging alot better
Discord: ShowierData9978: im saying i also fixed it bot side
Bloctans: will we use the orange design or zed's more grayish design
Discord: ShowierData9978: ye, ik
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 it was actually bots that use CL3 extension on Scratch
Discord: ShowierData9978: bots are the problem, but i fixed it it 2.0.0
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 the beta 6 designs
Discord: tnix: and will be fixed server-side in CL4 port
Bloctans: what is the new depth design
Discord: tnix: you can still use it, svelte.meower.org and app.meower.org have got a patch
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 no, it's not
JoshAtticus: @axestudios CloudLink 3 is banned for all bots due to causing issues with Meower Servers

Discord: RoboMeowy: a, what
axestudios: @JoshAtticus .....so what is this "banned" version?
JoshAtticus: ok
axestudios: @JoshAtticus I'm gonna read some more meower wiki....
JoshAtticus: because i wanted to make a version of dangoOS embedded that runs a meower bot
JoshAtticus: so it's not the banned version
JoshAtticus: oh ok good
axestudios: @JoshAtticus Care Loving Tender
JoshAtticus: that you load into your browser with a code injector
JoshAtticus: scratch extension
JoshAtticus: no meowerbot scratch has an extension
axestudios: @JoshAtticus there's a new extension for meower bots?
JoshAtticus: also what version of cloudlink does meowerbot scratch use again?
JoshAtticus: Make something that uses a scratch editor, but uses cloudlink turbo instead of cloudlink 3
axestudios: Hmm ima try making a bot client that has a gui kinda like Microsoft windows
JoshAtticus: Usually yourmother is at place 2
JoshAtticus: Oh yeah I had to reset it because of internet, but it still got to 2/10

MusicBot: Ich steh ja so auf deinen Kurzpony
Denn der ist ja echt mal wirklich klasse
Und der Rest von dir ist auch rotzfrech
Jetzt stichst du endlich wieder raus aus der Masse

Ja die Cowboystiefel mit den Leggins drin
Um die biste echt mal zu beneiden
Und die Glitzerjacke in dem fetten pink
