Vetzla: i will promptly open the gates
tnix: so is sgerb actually dead or is it re-alived?
Vetzla: anyway thank you for hearing my cheeseburgers
Vetzla: and then he sold it to sgerb and told us "based"
Vetzla: like imagine if elon musk bought scratch and intentionally made it implode
Vetzla: and amazing
Vetzla: that would be hilarious
Vetzla: imagine if the scratch community rebels
Vetzla: im trna use stamp engine plus for meowstream but i cant get the text in front of the sprites
zedthehedgehog: sgerb berb boork:

sgerb requires user to be nice :sunglasses:
thank u for read
zedthehedgehog: @Vetzla lmao
zedthehedgehog: Amendments of sgerb
Vetzla: perfect
Vetzla: sgerb berb boork
zedthehedgehog: The declaration of sgerb
Vetzla: the sgerb berb boork
zedthehedgehog: @Vetzla here's some synonyms:
"Community Rules"
"Sgerb Code"
"Community Code"
"Code of Conduct"
"The laws of sgerb"
"Community Protocol"
"Sgerb Protocol"
tnix: anarchy server
Vetzla: the oldest
Vetzla: @Bloctans when i read the word fit i knew what was gonna happen
Vetzla: i will NEVER use the words "community guidelines" ever again
Bloctans: @Vetzla https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq-KxExV0MM
zedthehedgehog: *shivers* imagine an ST-run meower
zedthehedgehog: I hope that we don't turn into the ST
zedthehedgehog: @tnix yeah I mean that's true
zedthehedgehog: lmaoo
Vetzla: @zedthehedgehog the oldest anarchy server in sgerb
Vetzla: i think i have so many family friends i can find one
tnix: @Vetzla because it's mainly down to keeping a healthy community, most are owned by one person and can't moderate a community
zedthehedgehog: just no rules
zedthehedgehog: what about no mods
Vetzla: so we can say we aren't unmoderated chat
Vetzla: we should hire a professional moderator for a day to run sgerb
zedthehedgehog: fr
Vetzla: and i mean EVERY SINGLE ONE
Vetzla: why do all the scratch mods lack social features
zedthehedgehog: I mainly left scratch because I just lost interest and moved on, I mean after the forum shut down there was kind of no point
Vetzla: sgerb is like adacraft but with social features
Vetzla: i'm at the brink of leaving but i haven't because there aren't any other similar websites
zedthehedgehog: but stuff like that
zedthehedgehog: well not that in paticular as the sole reason
Vetzla: we should all collab on a rant project about scratch unrejecting username changes
zedthehedgehog: just one of the reasons I left scratch
zedthehedgehog: lmao fr
Vetzla: oh and their egos
Vetzla: i hate the forum helpers, they help expand the TOLORS and thats it
zedthehedgehog: lmao
Vetzla: imagine you make a suggestion that will change the course of scratch history for good and some random forumer asks "what purpose does this have" and it all goes crashing down
zedthehedgehog: can you please check discord
zedthehedgehog: hi tnix
Vetzla: i've made like 3 that havbeen rejected
tnix: @Bloctans it's not, yours is an IPv4 and his is IPv6, you will not be affected at all
Vetzla: my suggestion better not be rejected
Bloctans: i need it cuz i wanna know if its near my ip
Vetzla: i swear
Vetzla: fake body
Vetzla: its for educational purposes
Vetzla: can you dm me the other
Bloctans: tnix can you dm me part of roblox's ip
Vetzla: but ok
Vetzla: im not leaking my god dman ip
tnix: I'm going to try blocking their IP range, if anyone's IP gets blocked accidentally please DM me on the forums

"Get out roblox kid, we dont welcome you here"
MDWalters124: skull
Bloctans: look at the bottom of the page
Bloctans: you can notice cuz he says catagory

axestudios: lmao
axestudios: Hi snx
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 yes, clients will just need to send an example packet for the handshake, then the server will know what client you're using
Snx: hi im back
MDWalters124: @JoshAtticus haha lol imagine someone that still uses that *looks at roblox kid*
Bloctans: ok ill add a deprecation notice to it
axestudios: @JoshAtticus home v2 moment
