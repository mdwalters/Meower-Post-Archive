Discord: theotherhades: enjoy dinner i presume
Discord: theotherhades: bye tnix
Discord: ShowierData9978: k
Discord: tnix: anyway gtg
Discord: theotherhades: as much as i love mdwalters and all the other under 13s i love swearing more
Discord: tnix: it's either get parental verification right now or ban users, I'll do parental verification if people are happy with that
Discord: tnix: we can require parental verification via email for now, would probably take a few hours to implement
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+ meower 13+
Discord: tnix: any idea for what we do right now are welcome
Discord: ShowierData9978: b6 is currently planned out of the window
Discord: tnix: @CST1229 we don't know what we're going to exactly do over the next few months during rewrite, but definitelly going to allow <13 users after rewrite
Discord: ShowierData9978: no, it was planned for b6 but....
Discord: CST1229: until rewrite happens
Discord: CST1229: *oh, so only temporarily banning <13 users basically
Discord: CST1229: @tnix oh, so only temporary basially

Discord: tnix: it's going to take a while and a lot of work, but we can do as much as we can to be COPPA compliant
Discord: tnix: @CST1229 scratch gets away with it by doing the bare minimum (requiring parent emails), and isn't primarily a social media site, but anyway we're doing a full rewrite for Meower over the next few months and are going to be COPPA compliant
Discord: CST1229: i feel like meower is gonna shut down soon
Discord: ShowierData9978: dang this was a fun random joke convo
JoshAtticus: @CST1229 oooooooh
Discord: ShowierData9978: yeah, we are redoing that /srs
Discord: tnix: what if we charge them per minute, and more based on whether they're online at peak hours or not
Discord: theotherhades: the only thing you can get for free is an orange screen with the meower logo in the center and a link to https://store.meower.org where we'll sell everything
Discord: CST1229: re: banning <13 users [image.png: https://go.meower.org/1a1ddc29]
JoshAtticus: dang I gtg
JoshAtticus: Just like fuel prices in Australia
JoshAtticus: But cheaper on Tuesdays
Discord: ShowierData9978: including the char that was just added
JoshAtticus: And it's more expensive on Wednesdays
Discord: ShowierData9978: @tnix times the current len
Discord: tnix: well ofc, that's the normal sub to get access to meower plus the registration fee
JoshAtticus: $95 to be exact
JoshAtticus: And you have to pay to create your account
Discord: theotherhades: they have to pay for the flight
Discord: tnix: maybe it should be like $20 per character to be hashed, so longer the password the more you have to pay
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix we send a meower secret service (MSS) agent to their address to watch over them at their computer
JoshAtticus: But if you don't pay $15 for that tier, then your home address, social security number, phone number email and credit card details are included
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades but then they'll just steal the code from any good password hashing algorithm
JoshAtticus: First tier still costs $25 a month, otherwise your password is included in every post/comment you make
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix add a second tier after plaintext where they have to write their own hashing module, then have a big price jump to the half hashed one
JoshAtticus: tw*tter is a very bad word
JoshAtticus: Oh I am so sorry i accidentally swore
Discord: ShowierData9978: (not like im trying to cover up the fact autocorrect did not save me)
JoshAtticus: ah ok
Discord: ShowierData9978: intentional mispell
JoshAtticus: Intentionally?
Discord: ShowierData9978: @theotherhades ThisPasswordIsIntencanlyWeak
JoshAtticus: @tnix No it needs to be another $100 sub
JoshAtticus: no tnix100
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades make it have tiers, one is plain text (available on API), one is half hashed with SHA256, one is full hash with SHA256, then it's hashed with bcrypt with no salt, then at bcrypt with salt, then another $50 sub to make it private
Discord: theotherhades: who me?
JoshAtticus: Also why does tnix's alt use a bettermeower pfp?
JoshAtticus: Yes that is a great idea
Discord: theotherhades: https://api.meower.org/fetchpassword?user=tnix100
JoshAtticus: Great deal
JoshAtticus: so you can buy 512 for the price of 1024
Discord: tnix: it gets better as you go up[
JoshAtticus: It doubles each time
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix they need a $55.59/month subscription to meower platinum for their password to be hashed and private, otherwise it can be fetched from the api
Discord: tnix: no, 10
JoshAtticus: No eight
Discord: tnix: and four for the price of 10?
JoshAtticus: And two for the price of four!
JoshAtticus: No, buy one for the price of two! It's simple
Discord: ShowierData9978: 8$ for sending a post
Discord: theotherhades: and it's buy one get one half price
JoshAtticus: OMG THAT IS THE BEST IDEA I HAVE EVER HEARD
Discord: theotherhades: simple
Discord: theotherhades: so we just charge a subscription for a pamphlet that tells them what subscriptions are for what product keys and what product keys are for what products
JoshAtticus: yeah, and $20 to reset password
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 nah, $10 for each password attempt, it costs the server time checking their password hash, poor server
JoshAtticus: And $5 for every time they see a post
Discord: theotherhades: people will get tired of remembering all the product key subscriptions right?
Discord: ShowierData9978: (this is great as a joke convo)
JoshAtticus: Or clicks on a button/link
JoshAtticus: Or logs out
JoshAtticus: We need to charge $10 every time someone logs in
Discord: theotherhades: 😲 big brain idea i just had
Discord: ShowierData9978: (lmao)
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix and charge a subscription for a product key as well
JoshAtticus: no put it on that weird headset that kills you
Discord: tnix: make our own VR headset
Discord: theotherhades: no that's selling out to zuck
JoshAtticus: No make meower only available on meta quest pro
Discord: ShowierData9978: and you need the old sub to cancel the new one
Discord: tnix: @cat so the 1st one was already done by the 2nd one, but what does Meower 3D look like
Discord: theotherhades: @cat nah 4d is better
Discord: cat: 1. I call dibs on making the next major decision for Meower
2. Meower is becoming 3D
JoshAtticus: But you need a subscription to get that subscription
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 a subscription cancellation subscription? I like it
JoshAtticus: @tnix No, you need a subscription to cancel the subscription
JoshAtticus: and use a different email address for each email like facebook
Discord: tnix: offer the option to cancel the subscription, but do what adobe does, charge them a massive cancellation fee
JoshAtticus: no unsubscribe button
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades go to the store and buy one, duh
JoshAtticus: with ads to buy the pc and subscription
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades no we spam your email
Discord: ShowierData9978: thats what the product key is
Discord: theotherhades: @joshatticus if it explodes there's no one to buy more subscriptions
Discord: cat: @cat it mine now
JoshAtticus: No you need to add a subscription to own the pc, or it explodes
Discord: theotherhades: also there's meower gold which gives you meower orange perms as well as 1 extra character on the post length limit for every $9.99 you spend per month
Discord: ShowierData9978: and the reader and computer explodes after the product key expires
Discord: cat: I call dibs on meower
Discord: tnix: but also, we need them to pay some validation fees for actually verifying the product key once they enter it into Meower
JoshAtticus: I always used the free version, but it would only update drivers for bluetooth and usb, nothing useful
JoshAtticus: iobit is a scam
Discord: cat: don’t give nvidia ideas
Discord: theotherhades: and the product key expires after a week
JoshAtticus: $9.99 a month for iOBIT driver updater premium
Discord: theotherhades: oh and the meower pc with vhs reader only runs men os which you need to buy a product key for
Discord: cat: @tnix agreed
Discord: tnix: no, drivers should be a subscription
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades And pay $19.99 for the driver disk
Discord: theotherhades: @cat vhs tapes so you have to buy the Meower PC with VHS Reader ® as well
JoshAtticus: I only moved dash to bottom of the screen with unity tweaker
JoshAtticus: No, I haven't messed around in settings
JoshAtticus: Ubuntu Unity 22.10
Discord: tnix: what OS are you on?
JoshAtticus: 









but only right works on linebreaks
JoshAtticus: LEFT SHIFT WORKS FOR SHIFT 
Discord: cat: meower orange is distributed on dvds
Discord: tnix: any if your keyboard works properly
JoshAtticus: no only right shift works
Discord: tnix: any shift is linebreak
Discord: theotherhades: or dog if you're weird like that
JoshAtticus: bruh it stopped working
Discord: theotherhades: @tnix for your cat you know
JoshAtticus: sdfgdfgSFDgdfg
JoshAtticus: ghDFgfdg
Discord: theotherhades: 110%
JoshAtticus: wait what when was right shift linebreak!?!?!??!
Discord: tnix: why would you buy multiple of Meower Orange?
JoshAtticus: No, 99%

Discord: theotherhades: 80% shipping fee
Discord: theotherhades: @JoshAtticus#0000 the shipping fee should be a percentage though so the more the buy the more they pay
JoshAtticus: Because we need to send you a physical activation key letter thing
JoshAtticus: Include the $139 shipping fee
Discord: tnix: @theotherhades ah true, $29.99, with some tax "for payment processing" (but they actually already have to pay for payment processing anyway)
JoshAtticus: **$2900
JoshAtticus: @theotherhades **$290
Discord: theotherhades: *$29.99
Discord: theotherhades: (hint: it actually is)
JoshAtticus: lmao linebreaks just worked
Discord: theotherhades: $29 so we trick people into thinking it isn't actually $30
JoshAtticus: @tnix yes
Discord: tnix: *be smarter
Discord: ShowierData9978: (monthly)
JoshAtticus: >>> babe <<<
Discord: tnix: nah, we better smart than musk, we keep it at the original $20, more profit
Discord: theotherhades: @Tnix (NZDT) can you answer my question in #general babe
Discord: ShowierData9978: B

Discord: theotherhades: 🤯 woah [image.png: https://go.meower.org/887fd91f]

JoshAtticus: Imagine going to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=

Discord: ShowierData9978: still gonna be there

JoshAtticus: what will happen to meower live chat home thing

JoshAtticus: @tnix Not entirely true, you would just need parental controls
Onezoop: why is coppa even a concern for yall
Bloctans: why not make meower jr
meower but stripped in every way
Discord: tnix: we could do that, but would stop our ability to grow since everything will have to be safe for kids
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus roblox isnt really COPPA
Onezoop: 1984
Discord: ShowierData9978: roblox is **** tbh
Onezoop: with lots of money and profit incentives
Discord: tnix: @JoshAtticus#0000 they're not primarily social sites and have everything safe for kids
JoshAtticus: how did roblox and scratch do it
JoshAtticus: surely there's a way to get coppa certified
Discord: Semisol: also, everything may change, there's still at least a month
Discord: ShowierData9978: we are thinking of a way to do it like scratch
JoshAtticus: 😭
Onezoop: can this get better music?

JoshAtticus: I don't want to leave
JoshAtticus: But it isn't at that point yet
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @JoshAtticus#0000 Continuing with the social media for all ages thing may cause legal issues down the road
JoshAtticus: 😭😭😭😭
Bloctans: @JoshAtticus im moving sgerb to GJ
Discord: zedthehedgehog: Meower is unfortunately not above the law
JoshAtticus: but aren't you coppa compliant

Discord: Semisol: if you were going to do actual things you would have done it
MDWalters124: @Semisol i will stop trying to go on a meower domain
MDWalters124: haha lol wait until i do demonstration MEOWER TEAM GONNA GET ANGRY
Discord: tnix: it's not really exploiting though, you're literally just ban evading
Discord: tnix: and as Semisol said, not properly disclosing vulnerabilities will result in immediate IP ban, but since they're fake I guess nothing will happen anyway
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @Semisol exactly
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 okay
Discord: Semisol: no one is falling for it just stop trying
MDWalters124: fun fact: it's literally so easy to exploit the bridge btw
Bloctans: @MDWalters124 gamejolt.com sign up
Discord: zedthehedgehog: but judging by how you're "exploiting the bridge" and nothing is happening, I'm led to believe they are fake
Vetzla: this is chaos
MDWalters124: anti-furry
Discord: zedthehedgehog: If these exploits are real you're just helping meower honestly, helping us patch vulns
Discord: zedthehedgehog: If you can't well there is no exploit
Discord: zedthehedgehog: Show me the code
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 What exploit? The fake one you made up?
MDWalters124: m is not online
Bloctans: m check sgerb gc
MDWalters124: great! almost done exploiting the bridge!
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 so, anti-meower, what's good?
MDWalters124: so, anti-underagers, WHAT'S UP?
Bloctans: @Vetzla check sgerb gc
MDWalters124: @Semisol i never knew you guys test it lol
Vetzla: ok
MDWalters124: yes
Vetzla: mr letter istg answer the god **** question are you sane
MDWalters124: i thought you guys just run the code on a server :laugh::laugh::laugh:
Discord: Semisol: I recommend you calm down before the situation gets worse for you, my 2 cents
Vetzla: mdwaltuh are you sure you are sane
Bloctans: well its my only idea (aside from SCRATCH)
Discord: Semisol: do you think we don't have backups and don't test our code
MDWalters124: @Semisol omg meower mastermind spoke to me
Vetzla: we should still have some sort of presence in meower though
Discord: Semisol: okay have fun "exploiting" meower
Vetzla: idk
Vetzla: anywway the 8th billion baby as bornt
Bloctans: @Vetzla gamejolt
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog well, anti-furry
Vetzla: whats a jee jay
Discord: zedthehedgehog: I don't understand
Bloctans: @Vetzla gj time?
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 Why is your comeback always "anti-furry"?
Vetzla: i made it in koackly or whatever its called
MDWalters124: fine
MDWalters124: @MDWalters124 you want exploits
Vetzla: anyway i made a browser named pizza browser
MDWalters124: so
MDWalters124: i live in canada
Bloctans: @Vetzla i think the law for the uk is <18
Discord: ShowierData9978: its bound by us laws
Discord: ShowierData9978: the server is in the us
Discord: ShowierData9978: its the US law
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog ok then anti-furry
Vetzla: maybe it doesnt apply to me cuz i live in latam, but all the websites i use comply with coppa
Discord: zedthehedgehog: that you always say that you have as if it makes us scared
Vetzla: if you dont stop complaining about coppa
Discord: zedthehedgehog: What are these "exploits" you speak of
Discord: zedthehedgehog: With what?
Discord: zedthehedgehog: Okay
Vetzla: m i swear to god ill call you letter like back in october
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog time to exploit!
Discord: zedthehedgehog: Yes
Vetzla: isn't it 13
Vetzla: wait whats the minimum age for coppa
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 You'd be surprised on the work that we've done but if you weren't underaged you'd actually be able to see that on the discord
what a shame
MDWalters124: and is now on forums
MDWalters124: for 3 days
MDWalters124: banned
Vetzla: what happened to the roblox kid that was (barely) in the meowstream dev team
Discord: ShowierData9978: idk
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 who is that guy?
Discord: ShowierData9978: LOL [image.png: https://go.meower.org/786354d9]
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 MD if you don't want to be banned before Beta 6, I suggest you calm down
Discord: tnix: @zedthehedgehog ST don't do a lot about COPPA though, they just make people have to verify their parents email, and that is pretty much all you have to do for COPPA, but a site that is a primarily a social media platform is way more risky to try and follow those COPPA laws
Bloctans: @Vetzla yeah but it seems like they dont give a ****
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog no, let meower have troubles
Bloctans: i still wanna make the move
Discord: zedthehedgehog: Meower HAS to be this way or else we'll run into troubles later down the road
Vetzla: yeah but doesn't gamejolt also comply with coppa?
Discord: Semisol: ~~unless we're talking about my creative mc server where I am above everyone else~~
Discord: zedthehedgehog: I don't understand how people don't get that Meower is not above the law
Discord: ShowierData9978: its not til b6 the TOS changes are in place
Vetzla: rip roblox888i
Discord: Semisol: we aren't above the law
Bloctans: im underaged, md is underaged, josh is underaged
Vetzla: i know cuz of the tos, but why arent we staying tos or not?
Vetzla: yeah lets gamejolt, but why are we moving?
Vetzla: or the same idk, i skipped side classe
Bloctans: sign up for gamejolt lets use that
Vetzla: my man, i live in the other side of the owrld
Vetzla: IRL?
Discord: ShowierData9978: you got 2 W`s there
Bloctans: i mean we could do discord but nah

Vetzla: now i either get no Ws or three Ws
Vetzla: btw my w key broke
Vetzla: do we move to
Vetzla: AND WWWHERE
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @tnix Yeah, I hate to say this but we should've listened to the ST when they were asking us about the legality and COPPA and stuff
MDWalters124: ok
Bloctans: @Vetzla im here
Vetzla: @Bloctans im online, now YOU get online
MDWalters124: e
MDWalters124: roblox kid back on forums
Vetzla: but what are wwe moving about sgerb
Discord: tnix: yeah, there's a reason why every other social media website has the 13+ rule, and it's COPPA, it really ****s
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @Vetzla#0000 Just without ads, tracking, selling data, premium subscriptions, etc.
Vetzla: yeah i read that
Discord: ShowierData9978: https://forums.meower.org/t/tos-update-concerning-users-under-13-meower-roadmap/374/8?u=showierdata9978
Vetzla: so meower's any other social media website now?
Vetzla: i read the tos changes, but what are we moving exactly
Discord: tnix: @Vetzla#0000 we updated rules about underaged people because of COPPA
Vetzla: but what happened
Vetzla: @Bloctans yeah move sgerb
Vetzla: anyway what do you think of pizza browser

MDWalters124: @ShowierData9978 what i see in the end of the post is *shit* in my vocabulary
MDWalters124: i can do something
Discord: ShowierData9978: you can also just point an ngrock conn at cf 💩
Bloctans: @MDWalters124 true, but theres nothing we can do
MDWalters124: anti-underage chat
Discord: ShowierData9978: like mike did before the meower domain name (i think)
Discord: ShowierData9978: bots
Discord: ShowierData9978: that updates using botd
Discord: Semisol: there's also other alternatives so that's nice, worst case we run a test server
Discord: ShowierData9978: and you can make a repo with the URL
Discord: ShowierData9978: ngrock has a free plan
Discord: Semisol: like forwarding http
Discord: Semisol: ngrok doesn't cost money for very basic features
Bloctans: @Semisol i dont have money
MDWalters124: meower mastermind's suggestion
Discord: Semisol: 👍
Discord: Semisol: @Bloctans#0000 you use ngrok to make the test server public
Bloctans: @ShowierData9978 ok but how do i test with the bm team or you guys
Discord: ShowierData9978: not really
MDWalters124: ok
Discord: ShowierData9978: it is foss after all
Discord: ShowierData9978: we literally cant stop you running a test server lol
Discord: ShowierData9978: turn them off then MD
Discord: Semisol: yeah, you can, you can also run a test server
Bloctans: atleast i can still do dev
MDWalters124: you guys are filling up my notifications like ****

Discord: ShowierData9978: ye, i agree
Discord: zedthehedgehog: If COPPA didn't exist, this wouldn't happen lmao
Discord: zedthehedgehog: Yeah
Discord: Semisol: Meower is run by us and not you, and we decide what happens. Also, it's not us being anti underage lol, this is government bull****
zedthehedgehog: *shitr
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 Gocial will eventually have the same fate as us, with COPPA and shut
MDWalters124: anyway, have to go gocial
MDWalters124: we underage have the right to be online, OK?
helloitsme: @Bloctans @MDWalters check gc please

MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog ok anti-underager
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @zedthehedgehog We have to do this
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124#0000 It's because of the literal LAW Meower is not above the *LAW*
MDWalters124: what are we talking about, anti-underagers?
Discord: ShowierData9978: wait what
MDWalters124: :smile:
MDWalters124: what are we talking about, anti-underagers?

Discord: zedthehedgehog: (ignore non-simvoni, I messed up font link)
Discord: itsakuro: @zedthehedgehog k

Discord: zedthehedgehog: or here: https://new-website.meower-website.pages.dev/
Discord: ShowierData9978: hosting be like

https://http.meower.org/402.jpg

MDWalters124: me too
Discord: itsakuro: @zedthehedgehog dm it to me
Discord: itsakuro: @zedthehedgehog epic
MDWalters124: you don't want insecure social media
MDWalters124: @tnix *https
Discord: zedthehedgehog: I made it in HTML but it's **** and I need you to finish it
Discord: tnix: we're kind of going in the opposite way of 101, we're going from ws to more http
MDWalters124: @Semisol meower mastermind making decisions
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @itsakuro Yes
Discord: itsakuro: Also if I'm correct we're using the website design I made too?
Discord: ShowierData9978: b5 to b6 is like ws to ws with alot more http
Discord: Semisol: @ShowierData9978 but it's still not
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 no wait [image.png: https://go.meower.org/439193a4]
Discord: ShowierData9978: @Semisol its meant to be meowy related
Discord: tnix: @ShowierData9978 more like 403
Discord: Semisol: it represents transitioning from http to ws
Discord: Semisol: 101 switching protocols isn't suposed to be b5 to b6
Discord: itsakuro: **** lmao
Discord: ShowierData9978: people under 13 during b6 

https://http.meower.org/423.jpg
Discord: Semisol: you can use a test server
Bloctans: @Semisol no thats like in a year
Discord: tnix: you can still develop stuff and contribute in the GH, just no using meower.org services
Discord: itsakuro: @zedthehedgehog I made some a while ago with an edited Meowy (looked about the same, just recreated in Figma)
Discord: Semisol: you can still work on meower, and you are welcome to come back when you're no longer underage
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @itsakuro ?
Discord: zedthehedgehog: first time I've seen this in a whil [image.png: https://go.meower.org/988e1735]
Discord: ShowierData9978: how do i have 21 followers on replit [image.png: https://go.meower.org/0d775146]
Discord: cat: can I be invited to the gocial stuff
Discord: itsakuro: Are we still using the Meower error page designs I made before William tampered with them
Discord: Semisol: as I said we are banning underage users because we don't want to get into trouble with the law
Bloctans: i feel like ill be banned off meower
Bloctans: *gocial
Bloctans: @helloitsme can we use something else for glocial chatting
helloitsme: @MDWalters124 I’m gonna invite rn
MDWalters124: i didn't get invited
helloitsme: Must*
helloitsme: OK EVERYONE INVITED TO GOCIAL MIST JOIN GOCIAL GROUP CHAT (sorry caps e)
Discord: ShowierData9978: you cant create accounts with VPNS
MDWalters124: for now on i will call you meower mastermind
Discord: Semisol: we will also block VPNs, of course
MDWalters124: @Semisol so you are the meower mastermind i see
helloitsme: @Bloctans https://github.com/oofy123/Gocial
Discord: Semisol: now that I have joined the team you will not be able to mess around with Meower anymore
Bloctans: @helloitsme yeah
helloitsme: @Bloctans do you want to join gocial yes or no
Discord: tnix: @Semisol I feel like we should just use CF API to IP ban, like Discord does, it's easier and means no traffic from that IP will hit our servers
MDWalters124: @tnix vpn to the rescue! *ip banned*
Discord: ShowierData9978: maybe we should set up a CL to CF ip ban system
Bloctans: how do i get vetzla online
Discord: Semisol: so don't even try
Discord: Semisol: and starting from beta 6 we will fix all IP bans byp****
helloitsme: Filter glitch below
helloitsme: *Isn’t*
Bloctans: @tnix ye
helloitsme: @MDWalters124 isn’**** weird we have the same bday though
Discord: tnix: @Semisol and not a **** CL IP block that are easily bypass-able, an IP block within cloudflare so you can never touch our servers again with that IP/range!
helloitsme: @MDWalters124 lol
MDWalters124: @Semisol how's that
MDWalters124: HEY TNIX I FOUND A PROBLEM WITH THE BRIDGE, IT'S PAPER
Discord: cat: @Semisol I disclose that I will abuse exploits in the next 10 years /j
helloitsme: @helloitsme cuz I wanted to make minecraft 2
helloitsme: Is it weird I learned to code at 5
Discord: Semisol: I would like to tell you that the abuse of exploits without responsible disclosure is an instant IP ban
MDWalters124: how do we create....
MDWalters124: i say we do it in node /hj
MDWalters124: i say we do it in node /hj
Discord: ShowierData9978: 15yo in December moment

helloitsme: @MDWalters124 probably true
MDWalters124: @zedthehedgehog pov: it goes down to 20
Bloctans: where is velzla
helloitsme: @Bloctans if it helps you can join gocial

Discord: zedthehedgehog: @zedthehedgehog on scratch
Discord: cat: @itsakuro feel like helping
Discord: zedthehedgehog: let me guess there's still people attempting similar meower projects in collaboration forums as we speak
helloitsme: @tnix idk (fun fact: Meower is one of them lol)
Discord: itsakuro: @helloitsme epic
axestudios: Meowy should be over 13 in cat years /j

helloitsme: BRB gotta go get it
Discord: itsakuro: gib repo link
Discord: Semisol: the goal is to be able to reduce the impact of false positives by requiring extremely high confidence for any automated tempmutes until review, and using it primarily to prioritize reports/apply temporary actions if there are multiple violations
helloitsme: @zedthehedgehog Yes
Discord: itsakuro: i am, someone else i know is, etc
Bloctans: what
helloitsme: @Bloctans 
zedthehedgehog: @helloitsme Is there a repo on it?

helloitsme: @itsakuro new social media thing I guess
Bloctans: im already sad, and no access to meower will make me depressed as hell
Discord: itsakuro: @helloitsme whats gocial?? sounds interesting 👀
Discord: Semisol: there's false positives and false negatives
helloitsme: @Bloctans if you want you can come help me with gocial
Discord: Semisol: AI filtering can't just pull out "bad" posts, you need a balance
Discord: tnix: @Semisol especially now since we can't use posts from people under the age of 13
helloitsme: ok
Discord: Semisol: for AI filtering we already have Pythia, it's in development, since we don't have any reasonable dataset to train and test on yet
helloitsme: @Bloctans wait
Discord: itsakuro: @Bloctans ****
zedthehedgehog: @tnix Exactly, we have no legal team whatsoever and lawyers cost a ****ton
tnix: @axestudios and a ton of other people, it's going to be sad
helloitsme: @Semisol I choose to comply.
Discord: itsakuro: tbh i see coppa's goal i just hate how it is
Bloctans: well time to fall into a depression for 2months /srs
axestudios: Oh wow md will get banned
Discord: Semisol: you either comply with COPPA or you don't, and the 1st option requires more resource investment
Discord: Semisol: you don't
tnix: we can't afford having any legal issues, if Meower were to get in legal trouble because of something like COPPA then we're dead anyway
zedthehedgehog: Meower isn't above the law
helloitsme: How do I protect my platform from this
zedthehedgehog: COPPA is... the law
Discord: itsakuro: hi
helloitsme: @Semisol bruh coppa bad
Discord: Semisol: but we can't do anything about it
Discord: Semisol: this is the issue
Discord: Semisol: > its literally all about protection, they think we have the maturity of a 5 Y.O
helloitsme: @tnix what no
helloitsme: @helloitsme I’m still working on it
tnix: @helloitsme using children's data... yeah that's not great
Bloctans: its literally all about protection, they think we have the maturity of a 5 Y.O
helloitsme: The ai goes through lots of training.
Discord: Semisol: it's going to be difficult
Discord: Semisol: to be honest parental controls isn't as easy as you think
Discord: Semisol: @tnix#0000 possibly yeah tnix
helloitsme: I can probably make parental controls and so trained chat filter
Bloctans: i hate coppa
tnix: and maybe makes it worse because we're using children's generated content in an AI
tnix: @helloitsme we will already have Pythia, but it doesn't solve the issue of COPPA
helloitsme: Nextfilter**
tnix: @Semisol more than days, since we have to keep up with hiding communities and profiles that we deem not safe for kids
helloitsme: @tnix hey I have ideas. Parental controls, ai driven chat filter I call nextfiltr
Bloctans: meower is my life
Discord: Semisol: it's just at most 5 users that would benefit from this and it would cost us probably days
zedthehedgehog: But COPPA is too powerful
zedthehedgehog: We were planning for parental controls
tnix: I guess another site would be roblox, but they have filters and have issues with COPPA anyway
Discord: Semisol: well we could but it's so much burden it's not worth it and the teams working on meower would have their time better spent by adding other features
helloitsme: One question: can’t you just add parental controls
tnix: we can be compliant like Scratch, but it's a lot harder than that since Meower is primarily a social platform and not a place for kids to learn coding
Discord: cat: while we're on topic of development stuff
1. Am I team meower? It's not necessarily clear rn
2. meower take sgerb????
helloitsme: @Semisol so you can’t just add parental controls 
Discord: Semisol: I know that this is sad but we can't do anything about it, we need to add other features
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 Meower GitHub here I come
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 YAYA
helloitsme: Good news for bloc but what about me
Discord: ShowierData9978: you can still talk lol (via github)
Discord: Semisol: this had to be done because we do not have the resources for keeping the platform safe for <13 users and implementing everything required to comply with COPPA and provide parental controls
Bloctans: what about sgerb dev
Discord: Semisol: and you can use a test server, I guess
tnix: @Bloctans you can continue to develop, you can't use Meower services (or at least not know you're using them), we have to terminate any accounts we find are owned by people under 13
zedthehedgehog: I'm ver very sorry.
Discord: ShowierData9978: rip
helloitsme: @Bloctans don’t worry. We will find somewhere to be
zedthehedgehog: @helloitsme Hoping for around December
helloitsme: @tnix beta 6 release date please
Bloctans: its not just sad, i think im gonna be going into depression
Discord: ShowierData9978: thats after b6 btw
tnix: yeah, 7 days after we send out notifications will it happen, it's sad
helloitsme: Sad but in a few years I shall return
Bloctans: why tho, like im a big part of maintaining svelte
helloitsme: @ShowierData9978 ik
Discord: ShowierData9978: not til B6
helloitsme: @tnix Bye. It was nice knowing you and Meower 
Discord: cat: 0.7 should just be 1.0 imo
helloitsme: Gocial = go social/ game social
Discord: tnix: sgerb social
helloitsme: @Bloctans you can develop at gocial if you want
Bloctans: i cant continue to maintain svelte
helloitsme: @Bloctans @m
Bloctans: i have no meaning
zedthehedgehog: Move to other mediums I presume
helloitsme: What do we do next?
helloitsme: I guess
helloitsme: Beta 6 will ban us
tnix: @ShowierData9978 have a look at this post before spending a ton of time doing that https://wasteof.money/posts/63662f86c20a476c755c40ac
Bloctans: im crying rn
helloitsme: So when does this happen
Discord: ShowierData9978: i just learned bots a supported there
Discord: ShowierData9978: i want to port some of my meower bots to wasteof.money lol
zedthehedgehog: Like a full gdpr type thing
helloitsme: Ok. I guess I’ll go soon.
zedthehedgehog: Yes
tnix: @zedthehedgehog not just perma-banning, terminating, erasing their data
zedthehedgehog: That means perma-banning any known -12 users
zedthehedgehog: Yeah
helloitsme: @tnix oh
zedthehedgehog: I'm sorry to MD, JoshAtticus, and Bloc but we have to do this for legal reasons
tnix: @helloitsme we have to ban people under 13 when we make new TOS for beta 6
helloitsme: @tnix what happened
zedthehedgehog: so this was inevitable
zedthehedgehog: I understand it's put in place for lazy parents who don't pay attention
tnix: COPPA good in someways, but COPPA also ****s
zedthehedgehog: COPPA sucks absolute **** but whatever
tnix: yeah, we know it's unfortunate, but we have to because of COPPA
Discord: ShowierData9978: an annoying thing called COPPA
Discord: cat: rest in peace
Bloctans: but im a big part of meower dev
Bloctans: im under 13 too
helloitsme: @Bloctans what is it
Bloctans: @zedthehedgehog WHY
helloitsme: @zedthehedgehog he had to go
zedthehedgehog: It may concern you
zedthehedgehog: @MDWalters124 I need you to look at the most recent announcements forum post
helloitsme: @helloitsme how did he
helloitsme: @tnix they are from today
Discord: cat: @MDWalters124#0000 Meower is literally like the second result on google, how did they not find it
helloitsme: @tnix so these were from yesterday 
helloitsme: @tnix ah so he got ip banned
Discord: tnix: the account was terminated though
Discord: tnix: yeah, he ban evaded yesterday
helloitsme: But it might be @Roblox888i again
helloitsme: @helloitsme probably meaning we can’t track who did it
helloitsme: It happened yesterday 
helloitsme: @helloitsme annoying gcs are back
helloitsme: @tnix “ You have been added to the group chat 'Did you miss me?'!” help 
Discord: ShowierData9978: it used to work
zedthehedgehog: Oh
Discord: zedthehedgehog: @helloitsme#0000 test
helloitsme: @zedthehedgehog he’s used to discord
zedthehedgehog: Lmao
zedthehedgehog: *Oh
zedthehedgehog: Ohb
helloitsme: @zedthehedgehog discord bridge
zedthehedgehog: is that like a bettermeower thing
zedthehedgehog: @tnix why do you use #0000 after usernames
helloitsme: It’s terrible 
helloitsme: OH GOD
helloitsme: @tnix what
Discord: tnix: @Bloctans#0000 ****, someone just stole the name and startup sound, and then did nothing else with it
helloitsme: Idk why

@yeeter2001 Meower is not in scratch. It is a separate site. It does not have to follow scratch rules. I bring up the fact that it is moderated because it is not allowed to link unmoderated sites on scratch.
