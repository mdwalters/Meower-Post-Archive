axestudios: Leaked free ver. working app html
JoshAtticus: I don't even know what they were trying to say
JoshAtticus: The pre-loading screen shows chinese text which translates to "made free VER APP HTML"
JoshAtticus: It crashes on everything else, including an emulator
JoshAtticus: It also only runs on my fake iPhone 4
JoshAtticus: It's an HTML app upon further inspection
JoshAtticus: HPOS
JoshAtticus: Weird app

axestudios: I propose new FDE (flexible data editor) that can edit data in any shape way or form
JoshAtticus: Let me upload a video to youtube
JoshAtticus: It shows a slightly off Apple Logo, then goes to a setup screen which you only have to tap to get to a wallpaper, that's literally all it does
JoshAtticus: Lmao it's an unfinished iPhone simulator
JoshAtticus: called "HPOS"
JoshAtticus: I also have a fake iPhone with this random app
axestudios: What if there was a program that would replace your whole ram with the character 'A'
JoshAtticus: I had to bring it back so I can archive it
JoshAtticus: After installing Google Play Store & Services, the launcher was removed because it was spyware
JoshAtticus: Lmao it's just an Android skin
axestudios: I wonder how frequently it is used
JoshAtticus: There is nothing online about it
Bloctans: should i add twemoji to meower?
JoshAtticus: that's the OS this random phone i got from ewaste runs
